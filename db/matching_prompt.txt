Such teaching strategy accommodations for a student with dyslexia might include these elements: 
• Individual or small-group instruction 
• Written materials that are read to the student by the teacher 
• Provision of outlines, study guides, or organizers 

504 plans for students with dyslexia may include other types of accommodations, such as the following items:
 • Audio recordings of books
 • Text-to-Speech technology
 • Recordings of lectures 
• Use of highlighters to organize written information

Page 81
Below are some examples of accommodations grouped by task for students with dyslexia: 
• Accommodations for homework assignments may include reducing homework, allowing students to dictate their answers, allowing typewritten work, and allowing extended time to complete assignments. 
• Accommodations for mathematics may include the student’s use of a calculator or graph paper and the teacher breaking assignments into smaller steps. 
• Accommodations for reading may include providing the student with access to audiobooks and text-to-speech software; the teacher not calling on a student with dyslexia to participate in oral reading, unless the student volunteers; and allowing extra time to complete reading assignments. 
• Accommodations for spelling may include the teacher reducing the number of items on spelling lists, providing access to spell-check and word prediction software, and not deducting points for spelling errors. 
• Accommodations for testing may include providing students with dyslexia with extra time, allowing students to give answers orally, and providing a quiet testing area. 
• Accommodations for writing may include providing a student with a scribe, providing access to speech-to-text software, and offering written or digital copies of notes; minimizing the need to copy from the board; and providing graphic organizers. Students who are unable to use traditional print materials to access their curriculum may need specialized formats, such as large print, audio recordings, or digital text. These specialized formats are called “accessible educational materials,” or AEM. T

Page 98
Such accommodations might include having directions and word problems read to the student; seating him near a capable, helpful peer or close to the teacher; giving him extra time to complete assignments, tasks, and activities; or reducing the amount of homework so that time can be spent on other literacy activities without overwhelming the student.



Evaluation of eligibility for special education

During an eligibility assessment for special education, students are typically evaluated with nationally norm-referenced, standardized tests of academic achievement in addition to evaluation with informal measures. Woodcock-Johnson, Tests of Achievement, Fourth Edition (WJ-IV) Weschler Individual Achievement Test, Third Edition (WIAT-III) 

Steps to get accommodation for special education (ages 3-21) in Santa Clara County:

Child Find: The ongoing process used by educators and administrators in Santa Clara County to identify children and youth from birth through age 21 who may be eligible for special education and related services due to developmental delays or disabilities.

Referral: If a child is experiencing problems in school performance, a meeting with the teacher can be requested to discuss potential causes. If interventions by the general education teacher do not improve the situation, the Student Study Team (SST) may recommend an assessment for eligibility for special education and related services.

Request for Assessment: Parents have the right to request an assessment for special education services in writing or with the assistance of a teacher or administrator.

Assessment: The assessment process serves two purposes: determining the student's eligibility for special education services and gathering information about all suspected areas of disability to identify if the student requires special education and/or related services. Parental consent is necessary for the initial assessment.

Proposed Assessment Plan: The district must prepare a written assessment plan within 15 days of receiving the referral for a special education assessment. The plan should be easy to understand, provided in the parent's native language or preferred mode of communication, and explain the types of assessments to be conducted.

Developmental and Educational History: A specialist will obtain a developmental and educational history for the child. The assessment results will be provided in a written report, which should include how the child's disability affects their involvement and progress in the general curriculum.

Eligibility Determination: Based on the assessment results, a determination will be made if the student is eligible for special education services and related accommodations.

Individualized Education Plan (IEP): If the student is found eligible, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) will be developed in collaboration with parents and relevant professionals to outline the specific accommodations and services needed for the child's education.

Implementation: The accommodations and services outlined in the IEP will be implemented, and progress will be monitored regularly. The IEP may be reviewed and revised as needed to support the child's educational progress and needs.

It's important to consult the resources provided by the school or district for more information and guidance on the special education process.

Reassessments Info: Here's some info on REASSESSMENTS
A reassessment of a pupil shall occur not more frequently than once a year, unless the
parent and the LEA agree otherwise in writing, and shall occur at least once every three
years, unless the parent and the LEA agree in writing, that a reassessment is unnecessary.
Reassessment may also be conducted whenever conditions warrant a reassessment including the following:
1. If a parent or teacher requests a reevaluation;
2. When a preschool child with a disability transitions to Kindergarten or
first grade; or
3. Before determining a child is no longer eligible for special education.
1.7.A Three Year Reassessments
The three-year reassessments will consider the following in determining the need
for additional information:
1. A review of existing data including evaluations and information approved by the parents of the pupil.
2. Current classroom-based assessments and observations by teachers and
related services providers.
3. Observations by teachers and related service providers.
On the basis of that review, and input from the pupil’s parents, the team will
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine, including
1. Whether the pupil continues to have a disability;
2. The present levels of performance and educational needs of the pupil;
CHAPTER 1
- 16 - Reviewed July 2012
3. Whether the pupil continues to need special education and related
services; and,
4. Whether any additions or modifications to the special education and
related services are needed to enable the pupil to meet the measurable
annual goals set out in the IEP of the child and to participate as
appropriate in the general curriculum.
If the team determines that additional tests or other evaluation material is
needed to provide the necessary data identified above, the district will
administer tests and other assessment materials as may be needed.
If the team determines no additional data is needed, the district will notify the
parents of that determination and the reason for it and the right of the parents to
request an assessment.
The district is not required to conduct the assessment unless requested to do so
by the pupil’s parents.


P. 53 - 56: Parent start guide → we can use this for summarizing 
It is not required to know of the child’s diagnosis to request an assessment 
P. 98 - 99: Parents and their rights and what they can do, or where they can get more resources or help 
→ think of how to guide parents on this whole process so it’s easy-to-read and access? 
Prior Written Notice: The school district must provide a written notice when proposing or refusing changes in identification, assessment, or educational placement for a child with special needs, or providing a free appropriate public education. The notice must include details of the proposed action, reasons for the decision, assessment procedures used, parental safeguards, contact information for assistance, other considered options, and relevant factors.

Parental Consent for Assessment: Before conducting the first special education assessment, parents must give informed, written consent. They have 15 days from receiving the assessment plan to decide. The assessment can begin upon receiving consent and must be completed with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) within 60 days.

Parental Consent for Services: Written consent from parents is required before the school district can provide special education and related services to the child.

No Consent Procedures: If parents do not provide consent for assessment or services, the school district may pursue assessment through due process procedures. If parents refuse consent for services, the district won't provide them through due process. Partial consent to the IEP allows implemented components, and any disputed component may lead to a due process hearing.

Revoking Consent: Parents can revoke consent in writing for continued special education services. In such cases, the district must provide prior written notice before ceasing services and may not seek mediation or due process for providing services. The district won't be in violation of providing FAPE and won't need to convene an IEP team meeting or develop an IEP for further services.

Note: If parents revoke consent for special education services after initial provision, the district isn't required to remove references to prior services from the child's education records.
