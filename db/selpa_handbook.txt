IDENTIFICATION, REFERRAL AND ASSESSMENT
1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
All individuals with suspected disabilities from birth through age 21 will be identified
and referred to the appropriate agency to be assessed. Each individual will receive a full
and individual evaluation to identify the disability, determine eligibility and identify
educational needs.
The assessment information will provide the basis for an Individualized Education Program
(IEP) or Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) to ensure the individual receives
a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE).
1.2 IDENTIFICATION
1.2.A Child Find
The Special Education Local Planning Area (SELPA) and individual districts will
actively and systematically seek out all individuals with disabilities including
children with disabilities who are homeless, children who are wards of the State
and children with disabilities attending private schools, regardless of the severity
of their disabilities and who are in need of special education and related services,
are identified, located, and evaluated.
CHAPTER 1
- 2 - Reviewed July 2012
Child Find activities may include but not be limited to:
1. A comprehensive screening program, including health, vision, hearing,
speech and language;
2. Distribution of written information, including brochures and pamphlets
describing the referral procedure;
3. Public awareness campaign, including public service announcements;
4. Annual notices to local newspapers;
5. Consultation with representatives of private schools, including religious
schools on how to carry out activities to identify children with suspected
disabilities;
6. Coordination with preschools, Head Start and other childcare facilities;
7. Communication with hospitals, pediatricians, obstetricians and other
health professionals;
8. Coordination with parent resource centers and support groups;
9. Presentations to local professional groups and organizations established
to inform and/or to serve culturally diverse populations;
10. Coordination with activities of the SELPA Community Advisory Committee
(CAC); and,
11. Coordination with school site procedures, including referrals from the
school site student intervention teams (e.g. Student Study Teams, etc.).
(EC 56300, 56301, 52040; CFR 300.451)
1.2.B Student Study Team (SST)
The Student Study Team (SST) is a regular education function. It is a process of
reviewing individual student concerns and planning alternative instructional
strategies to be implemented in the regular classroom.
Although specialists, such as school psychologists, speech/language specialists,
and resource specialists may be involved, the SST is not a special education function
and as such is not subject to the associated restrictions and timelines.
CHAPTER 1
- 3 - Reviewed July 2012
A special education referral may be appropriate after research based intervention
strategies have been implemented over time. As a regular education function,
the team also helps with mainstreaming strategies for those students who are already
in special education.
A student suspected of having a disability under the provisions of Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, will be assessed by a process defined through local
board policies and procedures.
1.3 REFERRAL PROCESS
1.3.A Source of Referrals
Referrals for assessment to determine eligibility for special education and related
services may come from teachers, parents, agencies, appropriate professional
persons, and from other members of the public.
The referrals will be coordinated with school site procedures for referral of pupils
with needs that cannot be meet with modifications of the regular instructional
program, including referrals from student intervention teams, such as the
Student Study Team.
A child shall be referred for special education and services only after the resources
of the regular education program have been considered and, where appropriate,
utilized.
1.3.B Referral Procedure
1. Referrals for assessments to determine eligibility for special education
and related services will be made to the school site principal or designee
at the child’s school of residence.
2. Referrals may be processed through the school site Student Study Team
or other student intervention team to review the referral and document
interventions tried prior to referral.
3. All requests for assessments will be submitted in writing. If a parent
makes the request verbally the principal or designee will assist the individual
in making the request in writing.
CHAPTER 1
- 4 - Reviewed July 2012
4. The school site administrator or designee will review the referral. If the
information is incomplete the referral source will be contacted to request
additional information.
5. If the information is complete, the school site administrator or designee
will initiate the assessment process, including notification of parent. An
assessment plan may be developed or a Prior Written Notice letter will be
prepared listing reasons that the district will not assess.
6. No assessment will be conducted without written parent consent.
7. The district office special education administrator will assist, whenever
necessary to process referrals.
(EC 56302-56303; 5 CCR 3021, 5 CCR 3029; CFR 300.530)
1.3.C Inappropriate Referrals
If, after reviewing all relevant information, the administrator and assessment
planning team, consider the referral inappropriate, the parents must receive a
Prior Written Notice.
The Prior Written Notice must include the following:
1. Propose to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational
placement of the child or the provision of FAPE to the child; or
2. Refuse to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational
placement of the child or the provision of FAPE to the child.
The content of the Prior Written Notice must include:
1. A description of the action proposed or refused by the agency;
2. An explanation of why the agency proposes or refuses to take the action;
3. A description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report
the agency used as a basis for the proposed or refused action;
4. A statement that the parents of a child with a disability have protection
under the procedural safeguards of this part and, if this notice is not an
initial referral for evaluation, the means by which a copy of a description
of the procedural safeguards can be obtained;
5. Sources for parents to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the
provisions of this part;
6. A description of other options that the IEP Team considered and the reasons
why those options were rejected; and
CHAPTER 1
- 5 - Reviewed July 2012
7. A description of other factors that is relevant to the agency’s proposal or
refusal.
(CFR 300.503)
1.4 PARENTAL CONSENT
The LEA shall conduct a full and individual initial evaluation before the initial provision
of special education and related services to a child with a disability.
1.4.A Request for Initial Evaluation
Either a parent of a child or LEA may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to
determine if the child is a child with a disability.
(1) Such initial evaluation shall consist of procedures to determine whether a
child is a child with a disability within 60 days of receiving parental consent
for the evaluation and to determine the educational needs of the
child.
(2) Exception- The relevant timeframe shall not apply to a LEA if:
(a) a child enrolls in a school served by the LEA after the relevant
timeframe has begun and prior to a determination by the child’s
previous LEA as to whether the child is a child with a disability
but only if the subsequent LEA is making sufficient progress to
ensure prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and
the subsequent LEA agree to a specific time when the evaluation
will be completed; or
(b) the parent of a child repeatedly fails or refuses to produce the
child for the evaluation.
1.4.B Parental Consent for Initial Evaluation
(1) The LEA proposing to conduct an initial evaluation to determine
if the child qualifies as a child with a disability shall obtain informed
consent from the parent of a child before conducting the
evaluation. Parental consent for evaluation shall not be construed
as consent for placement for receipt of special education and related
services.
(2) Consent for Services – The LEA is responsible for making a free
appropriate public education available to a child with a disability
and shall seek to obtain informed consent from the parent of a
CHAPTER 1
- 6 - Reviewed July 2012
child before providing special education and related services to
the child.
(3) Absence of Consent for Initial Evaluation- If the parent of a child
does not provide consent for an initial evaluation or the parent
fails to respond to a request to provide the consent; the LEA may
pursue the initial evaluation through due process.
(4) Absence of Consent for Initial Services – If the parent of a child
does not provide consent to the initial provision of services, the
LEA shall not provide special education and related services to
the child by using due process.
(5) Effect on LEA Obligation- If the parent of a child refuses to consent
to the receipt of special education and related services, or the
parent fails to respond to a request to provide such consent:
(a) the LEA shall not be considered to be in violation of the requirement
to make a free appropriate public education to the
child for the failure to provide such child with the special education
and related services for which the LEA requests such
consent; and
(b) the LEA shall not be required to develop an IEP for the special
education and related services for which the LEA requests
such consent.
(c) If the child is a ward of the State and not residing with the
child’s parent, the LEA shall make reasonable efforts to obtain
such consent from the parent of the child for the initial evaluation

1.5.A Initial Assessments
A full and individual assessment shall be conducted for each child being considered
for special education and related services to determine if the child meets
eligibility criteria as a child with a disability and to determine the educational
needs of the child.
Once a student has been referred for initial assessment to determine whether the
child is an individual with exceptional needs to determine the educational
needs of the child, these determinations shall be made, and an individualized
education program meeting shall occur, within 60 days of receiving parental
consent for the assessment, not counting days between the pupil’s regular
school sessions, terms or days of school vacation in excess of five school days.
CHAPTER 1
- 7 - Reviewed July 2012
However, an individualized education program required as a result of an assessment
of a pupil shall be developed within 30 days after the commencement
of the subsequent regular school year as determined by each local educational
agency's school calendar for each pupil for whom a referral has been made 30
days or less prior to the end of the regular school year. In the case of pupil
school vacations, the 60-day time shall recommence on the date that pupil
schooldays reconvene. A meeting to develop an initial individualized education
program for the pupil shall be conducted within 30 days of a determination that
the pupil needs special education and related services pursuant to Section
300.323(c)(1) of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
The 60 day time period does not apply if either of the following occurs:
(1) The child enrolls in a school served by the LEA after the relevant time period
has commenced but prior to determination by his or her previous LEA of
whether the child is an individual with exceptional needs. This exemption
applies only if the subsequent LEA is making sufficient progress to ensure a
prompt completion of the assessment, and the parent and subsequent LEA
agree to a specific date by which the assessment shall be completed.
(2) The parent of a child repeatedly fails or refuses to produce the child for assessment.
The results of the assessment will be used by the child’s IEP team to develop an
appropriate Individualized Education Program (IEP).
1.5.B Assessment Plan
After a review of the referral, pupil records and/or other immediately available
material, the assessment team will meet to develop a proposed assessment plan.
A proposed assessment plan shall be developed within 15 calendar days of referral
for assessment, not counting calendar days between the pupil’s regular
school sessions or terms or calendar days of school vacation in excess of five
school days from the receipt of the referral, unless the parent or guardian
agrees, in writing, to an extension.
In any event, the assessment plan shall be developed within 10 days after the
commencement of the subsequent regular school year when the referral has
been made 20 days or less prior to the end of the regular school year. In the case
of pupil’s school vacations, the 15 day time shall recommence on the date that
the pupil’s regular school days reconvene.
CHAPTER 1
- 8 - Reviewed July 2012
The proposed assessment plan given to the parents or guardians shall meet all
the following requirements:
(1) Be in language easily understood by the general public
(2) Be provided in the native language of the parent or guardian or other
mode of communication used by the parent or guardian, unless to do
so is not clearly feasible.
(3) Explain the types of assessments to be conducted.
(4) State that no individualized education program will result from the
assessment without the consent of the parent.
The LEA proposing to conduct an initial assessment to determine if the child
qualifies as an individual with exceptional needs shall obtain informed consent
from the parent of the child before conducting the assessment. If the parent of
the child does not provide consent for an initial assessment, or the parent fails to
respond to a request to provide consent, the LEA may pursue the initial assessment
through due process.
The LEA shall not be required to obtain informed consent from the parent of a
child for an initial assessment to determine whether the child is an individual
with exceptional needs under any of the following circumstances:
(1) Despite reasonable efforts to do so, the LEA cannot discover the whereabouts
of the parent of the child.
(2) The rights of the parent have been terminated in accordance with state law.
(3) The rights of the parent to make educational decisions have been subrogated
by a judge in accordance with state law and consent for initial assessment
has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent
the child.
Parental consent is not required before reviewing existing data as part of an assessment
or reassessment, or before administering a test or other assessment
that is administered to all children unless before administration or reassessment,
or before administration of that test or assessment, consent is required of
the parents of all children.
The screening of a pupil by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional
strategies for curriculum implementation shall not be considered to
be an assessment for eligibility for special education and related services.
As part of the assessment plan the parents will be provided with a written notice
that upon completion of the administration of tests and other assessment
CHAPTER 1
- 9 - Reviewed July 2012
material, an Individualized Education Program (IEP) team meeting, including
the parent and his or her representatives, will be scheduled. The IEP Team will
discuss the assessment, review any additional information, discuss the educational
recommendations, and the reasons for these recommendations. Parents
will receive a copy of the assessment report and the documentation of determination
of eligibility.
Included with the assessment plan will be a copy of Parents’ Rights and Procedural
Safeguards. The parents will be informed that they have a right to obtain,
at public expense, an independent educational assessment of the pupil from
qualified specialists, if the parent disagrees with an assessment obtained by the
district.
No assessment will be conducted unless the written consent of the parent is obtained
prior to the assessment. The parent shall have at least 15 days from the
receipt of the proposed assessment plan to arrive at a decision. Assessment may
begin immediately upon receipt of the consent. The assessments will be completed
and an IEP meeting scheduled within 60 calendar days from the date of
the receipt of the parent’s consent for assessment.
Parent consent for assessment shall not be construed as consent for placement or
for receipt of special education and related services.
Personal contact with the parents to explain the process and forms is strongly
recommended.
If a parent refuses to sign permission for an assessment, the school district may
file for mediation/due process hearing. If the district prevails in a due process
hearing, the assessment can be conducted without parent consent.
(EC 56321, 5 CCR 3022)
1.5.C Assessment Requirements
Tests and other assessment materials must meet all of the following requirements:
(1) Are provided and administered in the language and form most likely to yield accurate
information on what the pupil knows and can do academically, developmentally,
and functionally, unless is not feasible to provide or administer.
(2) Are used for purposes for which the assessments or measures are valid and reliable.
CHAPTER 1
- 10 - Reviewed July 2012
(3) Are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel and are administered
in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of the assessments,
except that individually administered tests of intellectual or emotional
functioning shall be administered by a credentialed school psychologist.
(4) Tests and other assessment materials include those tailored to assess specific areas
of educational need and not merely those which are designed to provide a
single general intelligence quotient.
(5) Tests are selected and administered to best ensure that when a test is administered
to a pupil with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills produces test
results that accurately reflect the pupil’s aptitude, achievement level, or any other
factors the test purports to measure and not the pupil’s impaired sensory,
manual or speaking skills unless those skills are the factors that the test purports
to measure.
(6) No single measure or assessment is used as a sole criterion for determining
whether a pupil is an individual with exceptional needs or determining an appropriate
educational program for the pupil.
(7) The pupil is assessed in all areas of the suspected disability including, if appropriate,
health and development, vision, including low vision, hear, motor abilities,
language function, general intelligence, academic performance, communicative
status, self-help, orientation and mobility skills, career and vocational abilities
and interests, social and emotional status. A developmental history shall be
obtained when appropriate. For pupils with residual vision, a low vision assessment
shall be provided.
(8) The assessment of a pupil, including the assessment of a pupil with a suspected
low incidence disability, shall be conducted by persons knowledgeable of that
disability. Special attention shall be given to the unique educational needs, including,
but not limited to, skills and the need for specialized services, materials,
and equipment.
As part of an initial evaluation the IEP team will review existing evaluation data
on the child, including evaluations and information provided by the parents of
the child, current classroom-based assessments and observations, and observations
by teachers and related services providers.

a. Are materials selected and administered that are not racially or culturally
discriminatory?
b. Do assessment procedures ensure that IQ tests are not administered to
African American students?
c. Do assessments result in a written report which includes the findings of
each assessment and contain required information?
(3) To what extent is the assessment varied from standard conditions?
(4) What effects do environmental, cultural, or economic conditions have on the
child’s performance?
1.5.E Assessment Report
The personnel who assess the pupil shall prepare a written report, or reports, as
appropriate, of the results of each assessment. The report shall include, but not
be limited to, all the following:
(a) Whether the child may need special education and related services.
(b) The basis for making the determination.
(c) The relevant behavior noted during the observation of the child in an appropriate
setting.
(d) The relationship of that behavior to the child’s academic and social functioning.

1.6 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Upon completion of the administration of tests and other evaluation materials, the determination
of whether the student is an individual with a disability shall be made by
the IEP Team, including the parents of the child and assessment personnel. The IEP
Team will take into account all the relevant material, which is available on the pupil. No
single score or product of scores shall be used as sole criterion for the decision.
Three primary factors must be considered in making this determination:
1. Does the pupil meet the eligibility criteria as an individual with a disability?
2. Does the severity of the disability have an adverse effect on the pupil’s
educational performance?
3. Does the child require special education and services to achieve a free
appropriate public education?

Refer to Chapter 4 in the Special Education Procedural Supplements for specific
eligibility criteria and IEP implementation guidelines.
1.6.B Special Rule for Eligibility Determination
In making a determination of eligibility, a child shall not be determined to
be a child with a disability if the determinant factor for such determination
is:
(A) lack of appropriate instruction in reading, including the
essential components of reading instruction.
(B) lack of instruction in math; or
(C) limited English proficiency
(EC 56333-56339; 5 CCR 3030; CFR 300.7, 300.534)
1.6.C Evaluations before Change in Eligibility
1. A LEA shall evaluate a child with a disability before determining that
the child is no longer a child with a disability.
2. Exception
A. The evaluation shall not be required before the termination of a
child’s eligibility due to graduation from secondary school with a
regular diploma, or due to exceeding the age eligibility for a free
appropriate public education.
3. Summary of Performance
For a child whose eligibility terminates due to graduation from
secondary school with a regular diploma, or due to exceeding the
age eligibility for a free appropriate public education the LEA
shall provide the child with a summary of the child’s academic
CHAPTER 1
- 14 - Reviewed July 2012
achievement and functional performance, which shall include recommendations
on how to assist the child in meeting the child’s
postsecondary goals.
1.6.D Section 504 Guidance
1. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) is Congress’
directive to schools receiving any federal funding to eliminate
discrimination based on disability from all aspects of school
operation. It states, “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability
…, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistant….”
However, as Section 504 eligibility, requirements and
services often overlap with those in the IDEA, the SELPA is frequently
called upon to provide information and clarification about
Section 504. Some students may be eligible for protections and
services under IDEA and Section 504; others are eligible under
Section 504 only.
2. Because the school districts in the Santa Clara County SELPA are recipients
of federal funding, they are required to provide eligible
students with disabilities with equal access (both physical and academic)
to services, programs, and activities offered by its schools.
Accommodations, supports and interventions for students eligible
solely under s Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Americans
with Disabilities Act do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Santa
Clara County SELPA or district special education. The SELPA is
mandated to coordinate and facilitate services to students under
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) only.
3. There are two original main purposes to Section 504. The first purpose
of Section 504 is to protect students from discrimination under
federal law. The ADA provides the same protections. The
laws assure access to educational services and the learning process
that is equal to that given to students who do not have disabilities.
All students who have a physical or intellectual impairment,
which substantially limits one or more major life activities, have a
record of such an impairment, or are regarded as having such an
impairment, are protected from discrimination under Section 504
and ADA. Section 504 also requires districts to provide a free appropriate
public education (“FAPE”) to those students who actually
have a physical or intellectual impairment that substantially
CHAPTER 1
- 15 - Reviewed July 2012
limits one or more major life activities. The provision of FAPE is
accomplished through the creation and implementation of a Section
504 Plan. Only those students who satisfy all of the criteria
are eligible for, and are provided, regular or special education and
related aids and services under Section 504. The ADA does not
require provision of FAPE through a plan.
1.7 REASSESSMENTS
A reassessment of a pupil shall occur not more frequently than once a year, unless the
parent and the LEA agree otherwise in writing, and shall occur at least once every three
years, unless the parent and the LEA agree in writing, that a reassessment is unnecessary.
Reassessment may also be conducted whenever conditions warrant a reassessment including
the following:
1. If a parent or teacher requests a reevaluation;
2. When a preschool child with a disability transitions to Kindergarten or
first grade; or
3. Before determining a child is no longer eligible for special education.
1.7.A Three Year Reassessments
The three-year reassessments will consider the following in determining the need
for additional information:
1. A review of existing data including evaluations and information approved
by the parents of the pupil.
2. Current classroom-based assessments and observations by teachers and
related services providers.
3. Observations by teachers and related service providers.
On the basis of that review, and input from the pupil’s parents, the team will
identify what additional data, if any, are needed to determine, including
1. Whether the pupil continues to have a disability;
2. The present levels of performance and educational needs of the pupil;
CHAPTER 1
- 16 - Reviewed July 2012
3. Whether the pupil continues to need special education and related
services; and,
4. Whether any additions or modifications to the special education and
related services are needed to enable the pupil to meet the measurable
annual goals set out in the IEP of the child and to participate as
appropriate in the general curriculum.
If the team determines that additional tests or other evaluation material is
needed to provide the necessary data identified above, the district will
administer tests and other assessment materials as may be needed.
If the team determines no additional data is needed, the district will notify the
parents of that determination and the reason for it and the right of the parents to
request an assessment.
The district is not required to conduct the assessment unless requested to do so
by the pupil’s parents.

1.7.B State and Federally Mandated Behavioral Assessments
Following is a description of the behavioral assessment that is required for
specific students under State and/or Federal regulations. A functional behavioral
assessment (FBA) is required by Federal and California law and is part of the
disciplinary process.
Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA)
A functional behavioral assessment may utilize review of records, interviews,
behavior assessment scales, and may include observation of pupil behavior
and/or environmental conditions. A functional behavioral assessment shall be
conducted under the following circumstances:
a. The pupil’s behavior has resulted in disciplinary suspension beyond
10 cumulative days in a school year.
b. An interim alternative educational setting or involuntary change in
placement is being considered in a disciplinary context.
Updated July 2014
CHAPTER 1
- 17 - Reviewed July 2012
c. A manifestation determination in response to a violation of a rule or
code of conduct is occurring.
A functional behavioral assessment may be conducted under the following
circumstances:
• In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning or
that of others, the individualized education program (IEP) team shall
consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and support, and
other strategies, to address that behavior. (Section 1414(d)(3)(B)(i) and
(d)(4) of Title 20 of the United States Code and associated federal
regulations.
• In the case where a behavioral emergency report is written on a child
with a disability who does not have a behavioral intervention plan,
the IEP team will determine the necessity for a functional behavioral
assessment.
• In the case where a behavioral emergency report is written on a child
with a disability who has a behavioral intervention plan, the IEP team
will determine the necessity for a functional behavioral assessment as
part of the modification of the existing behavioral
intervention plan.
Following the functional behavioral assessment, the IEP team will develop and/or
revise behavioral intervention plan. This behavior intervention plan shall be part
of the pupil’s IEP and shall specify environmental instructional changes and
other techniques and strategies including positive behavioral interventions,
strategies and supports.
If the behavior intervention plan is not effective, the IEP team shall reconvene in
order to continue to make modifications to the behavior intervention plan until
success is attained.

BEHAVIOR INTERVENTION
The SELPAs located within North West Santa Clara County fully support the concept that all
students are capable of growth and change. This includes students with disabilities whose
behaviors are problematic and may need positive behavior supports and interventions in order
to be successful. When students do not respond to typical classroom management strategies,
then individual behavioral interventions, supports and strategies must be developed and
included in the IEP. The process for developing and implementing behavioral interventions has
undergone changes within the legislative confines of the State of California.
In June 2013, Assembly Bill 86 was passed by the California State Legislation and approved by
the Governor. This bill repealed sections of the Education Code known as the Hughes Bill. As a
result of this legislation, there are significant changes in the process of behavior intervention for
students with disabilities.
Functional Behavior Assessment
Under the new regulations, a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) may be considered:
• In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning or that of others.
Section 1414(d)(3)(B)(i) and (d)(4) of Title 20 of the United States Code and associated
federal regulations
An FBA must be considered:
• In the case where a Behavioral Emergency report is written on a child with a disability
who does not already have a behavioral intervention plan.
CHAPTER 1
APPENDIX A
- 19 - Reviewed May 2014
• In the case where a Behavioral Emergency report is written on a child with a disability
who already has a Behavioral Intervention Plan (BIP).
An FBA shall be conducted:
• In the case where a pupil’s behavior has resulted in disciplinary suspension beyond ten
cumulative days in a school year and no FBA-based Behavioral Intervention Plan is in
place.
• In the case where an interim alternative educational setting or involuntary change in
placement is being considered in a disciplinary context and no FBA-based Behavioral
Intervention Plan is in place.
• In the case where a manifestation determination in response to a violation of a rule or
code of conduct is occurring and no FBA-based Behavioral Intervention Plan is in place.
(California Education Code §56521.1)
Functional Behavior Assessment – Definition
A functional behavioral assessment may utilize review of records, interviews, behavior
assessment scales, and may include observation of pupil behavior and/or environmental
conditions. Because it is a form of assessment, an FBA requires the parent/guardian to sign an
Assessment Plan.
Personnel Requirements to Conduct a Functional Behavioral Analysis
California Education Code §56320(b)(3) states that assessments of students with exceptional
needs “are administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel and are administered in
accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of the assessments”. The California
Education Code establishes that assessments must “be conducted by persons competent to
perform the assessment, as determined by the local educational agency”. (§56322) Further,
California Education Code §56525(a) states that “a person recognized by the national Behavior
Analyst Certification Board as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) may conduct
behavioral assessments”. However, it is noted that educational agencies are not required to
employ BCBAs.
Personnel Requirements for developing Behavioral Intervention Plans
The California Code of Regulations, Title 5, §3065(d) states that in order to design or plan a BIP,
personnel must hold one of the following:
• Pupil Personnel Services Credential in School Counseling or School Psychology (issued
by CTC)
CHAPTER 1
APPENDIX A
- 20 - Reviewed May 2014
• Credential authorizing the holder to deliver special education instruction (issued by

• License as a Marriage and Family Therapist (issued by BBS)
• License as a Clinical Social Worker (issued by BBS)
• License as an Educational Psychologist (issued by BBS)
• License in Psychology (issued by Calif. Board of Psychology)
• Master’s Degree in Education, Psychology, Counseling, Behavior Analyst, Behavior
Science, Human Development, Social Work, Rehabilitation, or in a related field, issued
by a regionally accredited post-secondary institution of higher education.
Personnel Requirements for implementing Behavioral Intervention Plans
In order to implement a Behavioral Intervention Plan, the California Code of Regulations, Title
5, §3065(e) requires individuals must be qualified to develop BIPs as listed in the previous
section or be under the supervision of someone who is qualified to develop BIPs. Specifically
the individual must:
• Be qualified to design or plan behavioral intervention pursuant to 5 CCR 3065(d), or
• Be under the supervision of an individual qualified to design or plan behavioral
intervention pursuant to 5 CCR 3065(d) and
o Possess a high school diploma or its equivalent, and
o Receive the specific level of supervision required in the pupil’s IEP.

infant and his or her family, and may include home visits, group services, family
involvement, and/or parent education activities. Services shall be provided in
the natural (home, community) environment whenever possible.
Early Start Programs shall include, as program options, home-based services and
group services.
Home-based and group services will be provided through a transdisciplinary
team consisting of a group of professionals from various disciplines and the
parent.
Credentialed personnel with expertise in vision and hearing will be the primary
providers of services to infants and toddlers with blindness and deafness
whenever possible.
The frequency of home-based services shall typically be once or twice a week,
depending on the needs of the infant and the family.
Early education services may also be provided through both home visits and
group settings with other infants, with or without the parent. The frequency of
group services shall not exceed three hours a day for up to, and including, two
days a week, and shall be determined on the basis of the needs of the infant and
the family.
The frequency of home visits or parent involvement/education activities
provided in conjunction with group services shall typically range from one to

have a timely, comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation of his or her needs
and level of functioning in order to determine eligibility.
The determination of eligibility for an infant or toddler shall be made by
qualified personnel of the SCCOE as per Memo of Understanding and contract
between SCCOE and SARC. The determination shall be made with the
participation of the multidisciplinary team including the parent. Evaluation and
assessment shall be based on informed clinical opinion and include:
1. A review of pertinent records related to the infant or toddler’s health
status and medical history provided by qualified health professionals,
who have evaluated or assessed the child.
2. Information obtained from parental observation and report.
3. Evaluation by qualified personnel of the child’s level of functioning in
each of the following areas:
a. cognitive development
b. physical and motor development, including vision and hearing
c. communication development
d. social or emotional development
e. adaptive development
4. No single procedure shall be used as the sole criterion for determining a
child’s eligibility.
5. Standardized tests or instruments may be used as part of the evaluation,
and if used, they shall be selected to ensure that, when administered to an
infant or toddler with impaired sensory, motor or speaking skills, the
tests produce results that accurately reflect the infant’s or toddler’s
aptitude, developmental level, or any other factors the test purports to
measure and not the infant’s or toddler’s impaired sensory, motor or
speaking skills unless those skills are the factors the test purports to
measure. The tests must be validated for the specific purpose for which
they are used.
CHAPTER 2

readiness for kindergarten and later school success.
Prior to transitioning a child with disabilities from a preschool
program to kindergarten, or first grade as the case may be, an
appropriate reassessment of the child shall be conducted to determine
if the child is still in need of special education and services.
It is very important that the gains made in the special education
program are not lost by too rapid a removal of individualized
programs and supports for these children.
As part of the transitioning process, a means of monitoring continued
success of the child shall be identified by the IEP team for those
children of kindergarten or first grade equivalency who are
determined to be eligible for less intensive special education
programs.
As part of the exit process from special education, the present

Individualized Family Service Plan
An individualized family service plan (IFSP) is a written plan for providing early
intervention services to an eligible child and the child’s family. For an infant or toddler
who has been evaluated for the first time, a meeting must take place within 45 days of the referral
to the regional center or LEA to share the results of the evaluation, to determine eligibility,
and, for children who are eligible, to develop the initial IFSP. Evaluation results and determination
of eligibility may be shared with families prior to the first IFSP meeting. [CFR 303.340, CFR
303.342, GC 95020(b), CCR 52100, CCR 52102]
A periodic review of your child’s IFSP must take place at least every six months. A review may
occur more frequently if there are any changes to the IFSP or if you request a periodic review
with the regional center or LEA. The IFSP must also be reviewed annually to evaluate how your
child is doing and to make any needed changes to the IFSP. [CFR 303.342, CCR 52102]
During the development and implementation of an IFSP, you have the right as the parent
to
1. attend the IFSP meetings and participate in developing the IFSP; [CFR 303.343, CCR 52104]
2. invite other family members to attend IFSP meetings; [CFR 303.343, CCR 52104]
3. invite an advocate or persons other than family members to attend and
participate in the IFSP meetings; [CFR 303.343, CCR 52104]
4. have a copy of the complete IFSP; [CFR 303.402, CCR 52102]
5. have the contents of the IFSP fully explained in the language of your choice; [CFR 303.342,
CFR 303.403, CCR 52102]
6. give consent to services listed on the IFSP. If you do not give consent to a service, it
will not be provided. You may withdraw consent after initially accepting or receiving a
service; [CFR 303.342, CFR 303.404, CFR 303.405, CCR 52102]
7. have services provided in the natural environment or an explanation of why that
is not possible; [CFR 303.12, CFR 303.344, CCR 52106]
8. exchange information about your child among other agencies; [CFR 303.460, CCR 52112, CCR
52169]
9. be notified in writing before any agency or service provider proposes or refuses
to initiate or change your child’s identification, evaluation, assessment, placement, or the
provision of appropriate early intervention services to your child or your family.
[CFR 303.403, CCR 52161]
The notice must contain:
• the action that is proposed or refused,
• reasons for the action, and
• all available procedural safeguards.
The notice must be presented in the language of your choice, unless it is clearly not feasible to
do so, and may be translated so that you understand its contents.

Mediation Conferences, Due Process Hearings, and State Complaints
PARENTS ’ R IGHTS : A N E A R LY START G U I D E F O R FA M I L I E S
In Early Start, parents have rights and protections to assure that early intervention
services are provided to their children in a manner appropriate to their needs, in consideration
of family concerns, and in compliance with applicable federal and State statutes and
regulations. The following procedures are only for children under the age of three years. [CFR
303.422, CCR 52170, CCR 52172, CCR 52173, CCR 52174]
As a parent, you have the right to
1. request a mediation conference and/or a due process hearing any time a regional center
or LEA proposes or refuses to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, assessment,
placement, and/or provision of appropriate early intervention service(s); [CFR 303.419, CFR
303.420, CCR 52172]
2. be informed of your right to file a complaint or a request for mediation or due process; [CFR
303.510, CCR 52170]
3. file a complaint if you believe there has been a violation of any federal or state statute or
regulation governing early intervention services under Early Start including eligibility and
services; and [CFR 303.511, CCR 52170]
4. request a mediation conference immediately, prior to a complaint or due process hearing
request, or at any time during the complaint/due process hearing processes to resolve a
dispute related to any matter concerning federal or state statute or regulation governing early
intervention services under Early Start [CCR 52170(b)]; and
5. file a complaint if a due process decision fails to be implemented. [CCR 52170(b)]
MEDIATION CONFERENCES
Mediation is a flexible, non-binding, confidential process in which a neutral mediator facilitates
settlement negotiations between you and another party. Voluntary impartial mediation conferences
are a more informal way to resolve disagreements with early intervention service agencies
or to address alleged violations of any state and federal statutes or regulations. Mediation is
voluntary [CFR 303.419, CCR 52173].
As a parent you have the right to
1. file a request for mediation as the initial option for resolving a dispute or any time during the
due process hearing or complaint process [CFR 303.419, CCR 52173];
2. request a due process hearing or file a state complaint if the disagreement is not resolved
[CCR 52173];
3. refuse to participate in mediation [CFR 303.419, CCR 52173];
4. have an impartial person facilitate the mediation conference [CFR 303.419, CCR 52173(c)];
5. require that the mediation conference is carried out at a time and in a location that is reasonably
convenient for you [CFR 303.419, CCR 52173];
6. have all personally identifiable information maintained in a confidential manner [CFR
303.419(b), CCR 52173(g)]; and
7. receive a written document outlining the agreements reached as a result of the mediation
conference [CFR 303.419, CCR 52173(i)].
Requests for mediation are filed with the:
Office of Administrative Hearings
Attention: Early Start Intervention Section
2349 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 2000, Sacramento, CA 95833
(916) 263-0654 Fax: (916) 376-6318
[CCR 52173]
DUE PROCESS HEARINGS
All parents are encouraged to resolve differences at the lowest administrative level possible.
When differences between you and a regional center or LEA cannot be resolved, due process
hearings are available. You, as a parent, are encouraged to seek assistance from your child’s
service coordinator, the regional center, or the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) office.
[CFR 303.420, CCR 52172]
Circumstances leading to a due process hearing may be disagreements related to a proposal or
refusal for identification, evaluation, assessment, placement, or services. [CCR 52172(a)]
Your child will continue to receive the early intervention services identified on the IFSP that
he/she is currently receiving unless you and the regional center or LEA otherwise agree to a
change. If your disagreement involves a new service that has not started, your child will receive
all services identified on the IFSP that are not in dispute. This does not include your regional
center providing early intervention services after your child has reached 36 months of age, as
federal law and regulations do not allow states to pay for early intervention services under any
circumstances once your child transitions from Early Start. The program or programs your
child enrolls in subsequent to transition from Early Start is responsible for providing you and
your child services for which he or she is eligible to receive. [CCR 52172(g)]
Requests for a due process hearing are filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings at the
following address:* [CFR 303.420, CCR 52172]
Office of Administrative Hearings
Attention: Early Start Intervention Section
2349 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 200, Sacramento, CA 95833
(916) 263-0654 Fax: (916) 376-6318
[CCR 52172]
*The due process hearing request form may be obtained from your service coordinator, the
regional center, the LEA, and DDS website: www.dds.ca.gov/Forms/pdf/DS1802.pdf
The due process hearing must be completed within 30 days of receipt of the request by the Office
of Administrative Hearings. The timely issuance of the written decision may not be delayed
by any concurrent voluntary local efforts to resolve the matter. The decision will be final unless
appealed. [CFR 303.425, CCR 52172(e)]
STATE COMPLAINTS
Any individual or organization may file a signed, written complaint against the Department of
Developmental Services (DDS), the California Department of Education (CDE), or any regional
center, LEA, or private service provider that receives Part C funds alleging violations of State or
federal early intervention statute or regulation. The complaint process can also address remedies
for denial of eligibility or appropriate services. However, even though DDS is mandated
to investigate any complaint it receives, state law does not allow disclosure of the Early Start
recipient’s personally identifiable information without written parental consent, other than
authorized employees specified by the regional center or LEA [CFR 303.510, CCR 52170(a)].
Information or assistance in filing complaints is available from your child’s service coordinator,
the regional center office, or the special education local plan area (SELPA). DDS and CDE are
available for consultation regarding the filing of a complaint. Additional assistance is available
from advocacy organizations such as the State Council on Developmental Disabilities or Disabilities
Rights California. As efforts to resolve the matter at the local level are undertaken, a
complaint may be filed concurrently with a request for a mediation conference or due process
hearing. [CFR 303.423, CCR 52170]
Complaints are filed directly with the
Department of Developmental Services
Office of Human Rights and Advocacy Services
Attention: Early Start Complaint Unit
1600 9th Street, Room 240, MS 2-15
Sacramento, CA 95814
(916) 654-1888 Fax (916) 651-8210
[CCR 52170(e)]
Any individual or organization who files a complaint has the right to
[CCR 52170]
1. receive assistance in filing the complaint from the service coordinator, regional center, or
LEA; [CCR 52170]
2. not be compelled to use any other procedures under the Education Code or the Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act to resolve the complaint; [GC 95007, CCR 52170]
3. submit additional information to DDS that may be helpful to the investigation;
[CCR 52170]
4. receive a final written decision within 60 days of the date DDS receives the complaint; [CCR
52170]
5. receive appropriate remedies that may include monetary reimbursement or other corrective
action, and assurance that services will be provided appropriately in the future if the decision
of DDS includes remedies for denial of appropriate services; [CCR 52170]
6. have any issue in a complaint that is not part of a due process hearing be resolved by DDS
within 60 days of the receipt of the complaint; [CFR 303.512(c), CCR 52171(c)]
7. be notified by DDS that the hearing decision is binding if an issue is being raised in a complaint
that had previously been decided in a due process hearing involving the same parties;
and [CCR 52170]
8. have any complaint resolved that alleges the failure of a public agency or private service
provider to implement a due process decision. [CCR 52170]
The complaint must
1. be in writing and contain a signed statement alleging that DDS, CDE, the regional center,
LEA, or other service provider involved with Early Start has violated a federal or State law or
regulation; [CCR 52170(a)]
2. provide the name, address, and phone number of the complainant; [CCR 52170(f)]
3. contain a statement of facts upon which the violation is based; [CCR 52170(f)]
4. include the name of the party responsible against whom the complaint is being filed; [CCR
52170(f)]
5. have occured not more than one year before the date the complaint is received by DDS
unless a longer period is reasonable because the alleged violation continues for the child or
other children, or [CCR 52170(c)]
6. have occured not more than three years before the date on which the complaint is received
by DDS if the complainant is requesting reimbursement or corrective action as remediation
of the complaint [CCR 52170(c)]; and
7. the complaint may also include, if applicable, a description of the voluntary steps taken at
the local level to resolve the complaint. [CCR 52170]
8. be withdrawn if the complainant elects to participate in mediation within the 60-day
complaint investigation.

IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF ENGLISH
LEARNERS
3.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This chapter was developed to provide SELPA and District staff members with a
concise, practical, and sequential approach to the identification, assessment, and
programs for students with disabilities, who are English Learners (EL). When
considering possible special education and related services, extreme care must be taken
to avoid the over identification of students as having a disability, as well as the exclusion
of English learners who may have a disability. With this in mind, two specific
challenges are presented to educators:
1. To utilize appropriate assessment tools and procedures and to provide services
in the least restrictive environment
2. To incorporate language and culture into a special education curriculum
All English learners will be properly identified. Identification includes the completion of
the state-mandated Home Language Survey (HLS). The California English Language
Development Test (CELDT) is administered to determine English proficiency. This
CHAPTER 3
- 2 - Reviewed July 2012
assessment is to be done within 30 school days of initial enrollment and the primary
language will be assessed within 90 calendar days of initial enrollment.
3.2 IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL OF ENGLISH LEARNERS SUSPECTED OF
HAVING A DISABILITY
Procedures for Identification and referral for special education and related services for
all students are described in Chapter 1.
3.3 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EL STUDENTS PRIOR TO REFERRAL
Unless the student has a severe disability, including but not limited to severe vision and
hearing impairments, severe physical impairment, severe intellectual disability, autism,
or severe health impairment, the student should be allowed sufficient time to acquire
English proficiency and receive appropriate academic instruction in English language
arts and math.
It is critical to differentiate between a student who is not achieving in the classroom
because English is not his/her primary language and a student who is not achieving due
to a disability.
Following are some relevant sections of state and federal law that are particularly
important in determining eligibility for special education instruction and services:
Education Code (EC) 56303: “A pupil shall be referred for special education instruction and
services only after the resources of the regular education program have been considered, and when
appropriate, utilized”
California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 5 3023 (b) “The normal process of second language
acquisition, as well as manifestations of dialect and sociolinguistic variance shall not be
diagnosed as a handicapping condition”
Federal Code of Regulations (CFR) a 300.534: “A child may not be determined to be eligible....if
(i) the determinant factor for that eligible determination is ...1) lack of instruction in reading or
math, or (2) limited English proficiency ... and (ii) the child does not otherwise meet the eligibility
criteria under 300.7”
3.4 STUDENT STUDY TEAM (SST)
The Student Study Team is designed to offer immediate assistance and suggestions for
teachers, parents and support staff for an individual student who is not making progress
or exhibiting various types of problems in the classroom and/or school. Through
CHAPTER 3
- 3 - Reviewed July 2012
effective utilization of this team, many identification errors can be avoided. The Student
Study Team serves as a group of professionals and parents, who will discuss pupil
strengths and problems and possible interventions.
3.4.A. SST Team Members
Members of the team may include the following:
• At least one regular education teacher
• Bilingual personnel
• Principal or administrator
• Parent
• Special Education teacher
• School Psychologist
• School Nurse
• Counselor or specialists
• Speech/Language pathologists`
• Interpreters (as needed) (See Appendix C)
• Pupil (as appropriate)
• Others
3.4.B Student Study Team Responsibilities
Referrals for special education assessment are processed through the Student
Study Team. The SST will review the student’s strengths, concerns, prior
interventions and modifications that have been considered, and/or utilized. The
results of the interventions will be documented. A plan will be developed,
listing additional interventions, and the individuals responsible for
implementing them with a follow-up date to review the pupil’s progress.
When an English Learner is referred to the school site’s SST, the first step is to
gather information regarding the specific difficulty the student is experiencing.
The second step is to look at why the student is having this difficulty. When
gathering information about the specific difficulty an English learner is
experiencing, there may be a tendency to describe general performance
behaviors, such as, “The student is not making progress,” The student is below
grade level,” The student is having problems reading,” etc. Statements such as
these do not describe the specific difficulty that has been observed, which then
makes it difficult to design appropriate interventions. In addition, not knowing
the specific difficulty an English learner is experiencing makes it a challenge to
determine if the perceived weakness is due to extrinsic factors (e.g. inappropriate
instruction, normal process of second language acquisition, lack of formal
education, etc.) or a possible intrinsic factor (such as a learning disability,
language disorder, etc.)
CHAPTER 3
- 4 - Reviewed July 2012
When describing the specific difficulty the English learner is experiencing, the
difficulty needs to be measurable and observable. In addition, data needs to be
collected about the identified difficulty across different contexts (such as
different subject areas), in different environments (such as home and school), and
in both the primary language and English.
After identifying what specific difficulty the student is experiencing, the next
step is to find out why the student is having this difficulty. If an English learner
is experiencing difficulties only in English, but not in the primary language, then
the problem could be due to extrinsic factors rather than an intrinsic disability.
3.5 ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS
After interventions have been tried and programmatic changes have occurred, some
students, who have been referred to the SST will need a special education assessment.
Special assessment requirements for students whose primary language is other than
English are included in this section.
3.5.A Psycho-Educational Assessments
Assessment requirements important to English learners include the
following:
1. Assessments with pupils of limited English proficiency shall be administered in
the child’s native language or mode of communication, unless clearly not feasible
to do so (EC 56320, EC 56001).
2. Assessments shall be administered by qualified personnel who are competent in
both the oral or sign language skills and written skills of the individual’s primary
language or mode of communication and have a knowledge and understanding
of the cultural and ethnic background of the pupil. If it clearly is not feasible to
do so, an interpreter must be used, and the assessment report shall document
this condition and note that the validity may have been affected. (CCR, Title 5:
3023)
3. Materials are selected and administered so as not to be racially, culturally or
sexually discriminatory (EC 56320, EC 56001).
4. A variety of assessment tools and strategies will be used to gather relevant
functional and developmental information, including information provided by
the parent (EC 56320).
5. No single procedure is used as the sole criterion for determining an appropriate
educational program for an individual child (EC 56320, EC 56001).
CHAPTER 3
- 5 - Reviewed July 2012
The assessment team may include, but is not limited to:
1. School psychologist
2. Language and speech specialist
3. Regular education teacher(s)
4. Special education teacher
5. School nurse
6. Bilingual specialist
7. Principal/vice principal/counselor
8. Parent
3.5.B Other Procedures for Gathering Information
It is necessary to review existing procedures and their applicability for appropriate
identification and instructional planning. Appropriate standardized tests are often
not available in all languages. A broader variety of methods are necessary to obtain
the information needed to determine if the referred student is, in fact, an
individual with a disability.
Following is a brief overview of four assessment procedures.
1. Norm-referenced Tests: The norm-referenced test measures an individual’s
performance in relation to others on the same instrument. Key words often
associated with this type of testing include: reliability, validity, and
standardization. When using this type of test, it is critically important that the
pupil being tested comes from a background (e.g., language, socioeconomic status)
similar to that of the pupils on which the norms were derived is questionable. This
often is the case with English learners.
2. Criterion-Referenced Tests: The criterion referenced test breaks down an area
and measures what a student can do on each task in that area. No comparison of
one student’s performance with the performance of the group can be made. This
type of testing gives yes/no answers to instructional questions (e.g. Can the student
tell time by the ½ hour?) With this information, curricular suggestions can be made
leading to specific goals and objectives.
3. Systematic Observation: This alternative assessment encourages the direct
study of the referred student in a wide variety of settings. In systematic
observation, one selects a specific behavior to observe, selects an appropriate
measuring technique, depicts what is seen in the observation, and makes
interpretations. Since the student is in his/her natural environment, it is possible to
obtain a better picture of what the student is actually doing while using his/her
own peer group as a backdrop. However, the presence of an observer may alter the
environment and thus affect the validity of the behavior observed.
CHAPTER 3
- 6 - Reviewed July 2012
4. Structured Interview: This alternative assessment technique provides for a broad
range of information collection. It is designed to incorporate the expectations and
concerns of all those who are associated with the referral. Additional, interview
based assessments allows for the funneling of information and expectations into
the formal assessment system.
3.5.C Additional Assessment Guidelines
Following are additional guidelines to consider when assessing a student with
limited English proficiency:
• Assess language dominance at time of referral or evaluation by regular
education personnel.
• Whenever possible use two language dominance tests to establish functioning
information.
• Assess in student’s dominant language whenever possible.
• Assess using non-language measures (e.g., performance).
• Use a trained interpreter whenever needed.
• Assess achievement in both primary language and English.
• Do not accept scores on translations of tests as valid; use other, non-biased or
non test based measures to support the scores. (Document!)
• Assess adaptive behavior, mindful of different cultural norms.
• When considering the presence of a language disability, consider whether
primary language is deficient when compared to peers and school population.
Is language generally depressed (common in low socioeconomic populations)
or are there significant peaks and valleys? Is there evidence of a true language
disability?
• Students with disabilities are administered the California English Language
Development Test (CELDT) along with all other students under standard
conditions. Most students enrolled in SCCOE Special Education Programs
with disabilities may require test variations, accommodations, and/or
modifications. Test variations are allowed for a student who regularly uses
them in the classroom. Accommodations, modifications and/or alternate
assessments must be specified in the student’s individualized education
CHAPTER 3
- 7 - Reviewed July 2012
program (IEP). Students with Section 504 Plans are not eligible for alternate
assessments for the CELDT. It is important to utilize the Matrix of Test
Variations, Accommodations, and Modifications for Administration of
California Statewide assessments (October 2010) that is updated each October.
(See Chapter 15.16)*
* Master Plan for Services to English Learners 2010-2015, Approved by SCCOE Board of
Education on April 21, 2010 (Chap. 1, page 2)
3.5.D Selecting Appropriate Tests
Mattes and Omark (“Speech and Language Assessment for the Bilingual
Handicapped” 1984) present a test evaluation form for use in reviewing the
adequacy of published test instruments for local use. The eight areas included on
the test evaluation form are summarized below.
1. Purposes of the test. The test manual should be reviewed to determine the
specific purposes for which the test is designed.
2. Construction of the test. The theoretical model should be examined, and the
extent of the field testing prior to the standardization considered.
3. Procedures. Procedures for administration and scoring should be described in
detail. Test length, and qualifications of test administrators should also be
considered.
4. Linguistic appropriateness of test. Dialect differences must be considered in
selection. A minimum of two native adult speakers of the language who are
fluent in the local dialect should be involved in a review of test content.
5. Cultural appropriateness of test items. Test items and materials as well as
procedures should be evaluated in terms of their cultural appropriateness.
6. Adequacy of norms. The manual should provide a detailed description of the
criteria used in selecting children for the normative sample. If this information is
not provided, the validity of the norms for local use must be questioned.
7. Adequacy of test reliability data. To what extent does a test consistently yield the
same results. Tests with reliability coefficients below .80 should be considered
inadequate.
8. Adequacy of test validity data. A test with high reliability is not necessarily a
valid instrument. Validity refers to the extent to which a test measures what it is
designed to measure.

3.6 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
3.6.A Determining Eligibility
Specific eligibility criteria to determine if a child has a disability are described in
Chapter 6.
Refer to Chapter 6 for specific criteria for each disability.
The thirteen federal categories of disability include the following:
• Autism
• Deaf-Blindness
• Deafness
• Emotional Disturbance
• Hearing Impairment
• Intellectual Disability
• Multiple Disabilities
• Orthopedic Impairment
• Other Health Impaired
• Specific Learning Disability
• Speech and Language
• Traumatic Brain Injury
• Visual Impairment
3.6.B Specific Learning Disability
For a student to be determined to have a Specific Learning Disability all of the
following criteria must exist.
(EC 56337)
1. A severe discrepancy exists between the intellectual ability and achievements in
one or more of the following academic areas:
• Oral expression
• Listening comprehension
• Written expression
• Basic reading skills
• Reading comprehension
CHAPTER 3
- 9 - Reviewed July 2012
• Mathematics calculation
• Mathematics reasoning
2. The discrepancy is due to a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological
processes and is not the result of environmental, cultural, or economic
disadvantages.
3. The discrepancy cannot be corrected through other regular or categorical services
offered within the regular instructional program.
Alternative means of assessment may be used to determine the discrepancy when
standardized tests are considered to be invalid; however, the same standard of
severe discrepancy used with English speaking pupils must be used with EL pupils.
3.7 PROGRAM OPTIONS
All students in need of special education and related services, including students
identified as English learners, are to be served under the requirements of current state
and federal law.
Districts need to offer appropriate resources to ensure that each English learner with a
disability receives appropriate educational and linguistic opportunities in the least restrictive
environment. A full continuum of program options will be available to each student with
a disability. To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated
with their typically developing peers.
A full continuum of program options include, but are not limited to the
following:
1. Regular education program with specially designed modification.
2. Regular education program majority of the day with some special
education specialist or resource specialist support
3. Regular classroom with specialized academic instruction for the majority
of the day from SDC/and or special education specialist and/or related
services support.
4. Special classes and centers.
5. Nonpublic schools
6. State special schools
7. Residential placement

INTERPRETERS
An acute national shortage of bilingual psychologists, speech and language pathologists and
special education teachers requires reliance on interpreters. Informed participation by an
interpreter will assist in appropriate administration of assessment instruments. It is imperative
that interpreters be sensitive to the cultural and linguistic differences which may influence
assessment decisions, enhance parental input, and contribute to educational planning.
Criteria for Selecting Interpreters
Ideally, a school district should arrange for a pool of interpreters, either using personnel with
bilingual skills or hiring outside interpreters. In either case, interpreters should have
qualifications other than bilingual skills. In developing a pool of interpreters, the following
should be considered:
1. Language and Dialects Spoken
Because some language have distinct dialects, it is important to ensure that your
interpreters can speak the dialect of the individuals school personnel wish to
communicate with.
CHAPTER 3
APPENDIX C
- 20 - Reviewed July 2012
2. Ability to maintain confidentiality of information
Interpreters should be persons who understand the need for confidentiality.
Ideally, interpreters are personnel employed by a school district who are
familiar with and obligated to follow the school district’s confidentiality
procedures and policies. Training in confidentiality may be needed.
3. Familiarity with nature and purpose of meeting
Interpreters need to be briefed on topics that will be discussed. A list of terms
that will be used should be provided. An inexperienced interpreter may
incorrectly translate technical terms, such as “intellectually disabled” as
“crazy”.
4. Professionalism
Since the interpreter will be “doing the talking for you”, it is important that the
interpreter convey the proper tone and professionalism of meeting. Appropriate
dress, manner of addressing parents, and sensitivity in discussing issues are also
qualities which should be considered when looking for interpreters.
5. Distinguishing opinion from interpretation
The danger of having interpreters convey the content from their own perspective
should be understood. However, the interpreter should be encouraged to
convey the intent when a literal word-for-word translation is impossible. When
this occurs, the speaker should be informed by the interpreter.
Effective Use of an Interpreter in Assessments
I) Before Testing – The assessment team member and the interpreter review the following:
a. The general purpose of the testing session.
b. Which tests will be administered.
c. Some information about the child.
d. Discuss test behavior.
1. Body language of the interpreter.
2. Excessive reinforcement – type and frequency.
3. Excessive cueing or prompting the child (verbally or with gestures).
II) During Testing – The assessment team member makes the following observations of the
child:
CHAPTER 3
APPENDIX C
- 21 - Reviewed July 2012
a. Mixing of two languages.
b. Use of gestures for purposes of communication.
III) After Testing – Note observations by the interpreter.
IV)Minimizing Interpretation Errors during Conferencing
A. Introduce conference participants.
B. Seating arrangements are critical. The interpreters should not block the parent from the
school person. Parents must be able to see both the interpreter and speaker.
C. Address your remarks and questions directly to the parents. Even though you are using
an interpreter, you want to communicate with the parents, not the translator. When
parents ask questions, look towards them and listen. Remember that much is
communicated non-verbally.
D. Communicate in short segments. Keep grammatical constructions as simple as possible
and minimize the use of idioms.
E. Avoid professional jargon. Explain terms such as behavior modification, reading
comprehension or dysfluency.
F. Observe body language. Rely on your interpreter to assist you in understanding
culturally appropriate behavior.
G. Ask the interpreter to remain neutral.
H. Make the conference comfortable and non-threatening. Limit the number of
participants, especially school personnel.
I. Caution should be used in including siblings, relatives, friends or acquaintances,
especially as interpreters.

PARENTAL RIGHTS AND PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS
4.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Individuals with disabilities and their parents are afforded rights and procedural
safeguards to ensure that all individuals with disabilities are provided a free and
appropriate public education (FAPE).
Parents can obtain assistance in understanding their rights and procedural safeguards
from the Special Education Director of their child’s district of attendance, the SELPA
Director, or the California Department of Education.
4.2 OVERVIEW
Local Education Agencies (LEA) have an obligation to seek out children with disabilities
between birth and age 21. A child with a disability is one who has been identified by an
Individualized Education Program (IEP) Team as having one or more of the thirteen
disabling conditions that are defined in federal regulation. Also, the child is one, who
because of the disability, needs special education and related services to benefit from
education and meets state eligibility criteria.
Children, with disabilities, are offered programs that provide for maximum interaction
with children with typically developing peers in a manner that is appropriate to the
needs of both.
CHAPTER 4
- 2 - Revised July 2012
4.3 PARENTAL RIGHTS AND PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS
The “Parental Rights and Procedural Safeguards for Special Education is at the end of
this chapter (Appendix A).
4.4 TRANSFER OF PARENTAL RIGHTS AT AGE OF MAJORITY
When a child with a disability reaches age 18 (unless determined to be incompetent by
appropriate authorities), the school district must provide any required notices to both
the individual with disabilities and the parents. All rights transfer to the child at the age
of majority.
The school district must notify the individual and the parents of this transfer at least one
year before.
If a child with a disability has reached age 18 and has not been determined to be
incompetent, but is determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent, the
school district shall follow the state procedures for appointing an appropriate individual
to represent the educational interests of the child.
All rights of youth incarcerated in adult or juvenile federal, state, or local correctional
institutions transfer to the child.
(EC 56000-56524; CFR 300.500-300.589)
4.5 PARENT REVOCATION OF CONSENT
Effective December 31, 2008, parents are able to revoke consent for special
education services and school districts will not be able to challenge the decision
through mediation or due process. Also clarified as part of these regulatory
changes: (1) If parents revoke consent for special education, the school district is
not required to amend the child's educational records to delete all references to
the child's prior receipt of special education services (34 C.F.R. 300.9(c)(3)); and
(2) If parents revoke consent for special education, the school district will not be
considered to be in violation of its obligation to provide FAPE to the child during
the period of time when the parents refuse to consent to services (34 C.F.R.
300.300(b)(4)(iii)), and is not required to convene an IEP team meeting or develop
an IEP for the child for further provision of services (34 C.F.R. 300.300(b)(4)(iv)).
Department of Education officials emphasize that when parents revoke consent
for special education and related services, they must do so in writing, and
although school officials cannot delay in ceasing to provide special education
CHAPTER 4
- 3 - Revised July 2012
and related services to the child, they must provide the parent with prior written
notice (and a copy of procedural safeguards) prior to stopping services.
NOTE:
Starting in January 1, 2013, parents may elect to receive an electronic version of their school
district's annual notice of parental rights and responsibilities, which is distributed at the
beginning of each school year.
In an effort to cut down on printing and distribution costs, Assembly Bill (AB) 2262 amends
Education Code section 48981 to allow a parent or guardian to opt to receive an electronic
version of the annual notice. For parents or guardians who do not request this option, school
districts must continue to provide the annual notice by regular mail or by any other method
normally used to communicate in writing with parents or guardians.
Providing access electronically may be accomplished either by posting the annual notice on the
school district website or sending it by e-mail. School districts will need to get written
permission from parents before providing the annual notice electronically. To accomplish this
purpose, we recommend having parents sign and return an electronic notice opt-in form every
year. School districts potentially could combine the opt-in form with the acknowledgment of
receipt of the annual notice form that is required by Education Code section 48982.
As required by Education Code section 48985, the electronic version of the annual notice also
needs to be translated into other languages if 15% or more of the students enrolled in a district
school speak a single primary language other than English.

Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B, and the
California Education Code
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
Revised October 2016
Note: The term school district is used throughout this document to describe any public
education agency responsible for providing your child’s special education program. The term
assessment is used to mean evaluation or testing. Federal and state laws are cited throughout
this notice using English abbreviations, which are explained in a glossary on the last page of
this notification.
What is the Notice of Procedural Safeguards?
This information provides you as parents, legal guardians, and surrogate parents of children
with disabilities from three (3) years of age through age twenty-one (21) and students who have
reached age eighteen (18), the age of majority, with an overview of your educational rights or
procedural safeguards.
The Notice of Procedural Safeguards is required under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (in English, referred to as IDEA) and must be provided to you:
• When you ask for a copy
• The first time your child is referred for a special education assessment
• Each time you are given an assessment plan to evaluate your child
• Upon receipt of the first state or due process complaint in a school year, and
• When the decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a change of placement
(20 USC 1415[d]; 34 CFR 300.504; EC 56301[d] [2], EC 56321, and 56341.1[g] [1])
What is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)?
IDEA is a federal law that requires school districts to provide a “free appropriate public
education” (in English, referred to as FAPE) to eligible children with disabilities. A free
appropriate public education means that special education and related services are to be
provided as described in an individualized education program (in English, known as IEP) and
under public supervision to your child at no cost to you.
May I participate in decisions about my child’s education?
You must be given opportunities to participate in any decision-making meeting regarding your
child’s special education program. You have the right to participate in IEP team meetings about
the identification (eligibility), assessment, or educational placement of your child and other
matters relating to your child’s FAPE. (20 USC 1414[d] [1]B–[d][1][D]; 34 CFR 300.321; EC
56341[b], 56343[c])
The parent or guardian, or the local educational agency (LEA), has the right to participate in the
development of the IEP and to initiate their intent to electronically audiotape the proceedings of
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
the IEP team meetings. At least 24 hours prior to the meeting, the parent or guardian shall notify
the members of the IEP team of their intent to record a meeting. If the parent or guardian does
not consent to the LEA audiotape recording an IEP meeting, the meeting shall not be recorded
on an audiotape recorder.
Your rights include information about the availability of FAPE, including all program options, and
all available alternative programs, both public and nonpublic. (20 USC 1401[3], 1412[a][3]; 34
CFR 300.111; EC 56301, 56341.1[g][1], and 56506)
Where can I get more help?
When you have a concern about your child’s education, it is important that you contact your
child’s teacher or administrator to talk about your child and any problems you see. Staff in your
school district or special education local plan area (SELPA) may answer questions about your
child’s education, your rights, and procedural safeguards. Also, when you have a concern, this
informal conversation often solves the problem and helps to maintain open communication.
You may also want to contact one of the California parent organizations (Family Empowerment
Centers and Parent Training Institutes), which were developed to increase collaboration
between parents and educators to improve the educational system. Contact information for
these organizations is found on the CDE special education California Parent Organizations Web
page at http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/qa/caprntorg.asp.
Additional resources are listed at the end of this document to help you understand the
procedural safeguards.
What if my child is deaf, hard of hearing, blind, visually impaired, or deaf-blind?
The State Special Schools provide services to students who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind,
visually impaired, or deaf-blind at each of its three facilities: the California Schools for the Deaf
in Fremont and Riverside and at the California School for the Blind in Fremont. Residential and
day school programs are offered to students from infancy to age 21 at both State Schools for
the Deaf. Such programs are offered to students aged five through 21 at the California School
for the Blind. The State Special Schools also offer assessment services and technical
assistance. For more information about the State Special Schools, please visit the California
Department of Education (CDE) Web site at http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ss/ or ask for more
information from the members of your child’s IEP team.

provision of a free appropriate public education. (20 USC 1415[b][3] and (4), 1415[c][1],
1414[b][1]; 34 CFR 300.503; EC 56329 and 56506[a])
The school district must inform you about proposed evaluations of your child in a written notice
or an assessment plan within fifteen (15) days of your written request for evaluation. The notice
must be understandable and in your native language or other mode of communication, unless it
is clearly not feasible to do so. (34 CFR 300.304; EC 56321)
What will the notice tell me?
The Prior Written Notice must include the following:
1. A description of the actions proposed or refused by the school district
2. An explanation of why the action was proposed or refused
3. A description of each assessment procedure, record, or report the agency used as a basis
for the action proposed or refused
4. A statement that parents of a child with a disability have protection under the procedural

7. A description of any other factors relevant to the action proposed or refused. (20 USC
1415[b][3] and [4], 1415[c][1], 1414[b][1]; 34 CFR 300.503)
Parental Consent
When is my approval required for assessment?
You have the right to refer your child for special education services. You must give informed,
written consent before your child’s first special education assessment can proceed. The parent
has at least fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the proposed assessment plan to arrive at a
decision. The assessment may begin immediately upon receipt of the consent and must be
completed and an IEP developed within sixty (60) days of your consent.
When is my approval required for services?
You must give informed, written consent before your school district can provide your child with
special education and related services.
What are the procedures when a parent does not provide consent?
If you do not provide consent for an initial assessment or fail to respond to a request to provide
the consent, the school district may pursue the initial assessment by utilizing due process
procedures.
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
If you refuse to consent to the initiation of services, the school district must not provide special
education and related services and shall not seek to provide services through due process
procedures.
If you consent in writing to the special education and related services for your child but do not
consent to all of the components of the IEP, those components of the program to which you
have consented must be implemented without delay.
If the school district determines that the proposed special education program component to
which you do not consent is necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to your
child, a due process hearing must be initiated. If a due process hearing is held, the hearing
decision shall be final and binding.
In the case of reevaluations, the school district must document reasonable measures to obtain
your consent. If you fail to respond, the school district may proceed with the reevaluation without
your consent. (20 USC 1414[a][1][D] and 1414[c]; 34 CFR 300.300; EC 56506[e], 56321[c] and
[d], and 56346).
When may I revoke consent?
If at any time subsequent to the initial provision of special education and related services, the
parent of a child revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special education and
related services, the public agency:
1. May not continue to provide special education and related services to the child, but must
provide prior written notice in accordance with 34 CFR Section 300.503 before ceasing such
services
2. May not use the procedures in subpart E of Part 300 34 CFR (including the mediation
procedures under 34 CFR Section 300.506 or the due process procedures under 34 CFR
Sections 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services
may be provided to the child
3. Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make a free appropriate public
education (FAPE) available to the child because of the failure to provide the child with
further special education and related services
4. Is not required to convene an IEP team meeting or develop an IEP under 34 CFR Sections
300.320 and 300.324 for the child for further provision of special education and related
services
Please note, in accordance with 34 CFR Section 300.9 (c)(3), that if the parents revoke consent
in writing for their child’s receipt of special education services after the child is initially provided
special education and related services, the public agency is not required to amend the child’s
education records to remove any references to the child’s receipt of special education and
related services because of the revocation of consent.
Surrogate Parent Appointment
What if a parent cannot be identified or located?
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
School districts must ensure that an individual is assigned to act as a surrogate parent for the
parents of a child with a disability when a parent cannot be identified and the school district
cannot discover the whereabouts of a parent.
A surrogate parent may also be appointed if the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth, an
adjudicated dependent or ward of the court under the state Welfare and Institution Code, and is
referred to special education or already has an IEP. (20 USC 1415[b][2] ; 34 CFR 300.519; EC
56050; GC 7579.5 and 7579.6)
Nondiscriminatory Assessment
How is my child assessed for special education services?
You have the right to have your child assessed in all areas of suspected disability. Materials and
procedures used for assessment and placement must not be racially, culturally, or sexually
discriminatory.
Assessment materials must be provided and the test administered in your child’s native
language or mode of communication and in the form most likely to yield accurate information on
what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally, and functionally, unless it is
clearly not feasible to so provide or administer.
No single procedure can be the sole criterion for determining eligibility and developing FAPE for
your child. (20 USC 1414[b][1]–[3], 1412[a][6][B]; 34 CFR 300.304; EC 56001[j] and 56320)
Independent Educational Assessments
May my child be tested independently at the district’s expense?
If you disagree with the results of the assessment conducted by the school district, you have the
right to ask for and obtain an independent educational assessment for your child from a person
qualified to conduct the assessment at public expense.
The parent is entitled to only one independent educational evaluation at public expense each
time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.
The school district must respond to your request for an independent educational assessment
and provide you information about where to obtain an independent educational assessment.
If the school district believes that the district’s assessment is appropriate and disagrees that an
independent assessment is necessary, the school district must request a due process hearing
to prove that its assessment was appropriate. If the district prevails, you still have the
right to an independent assessment but not at public expense. The IEP team must consider
independent assessments.
District assessment procedures allow in-class observation of students. If the school district
observes your child in his or her classroom during an assessment, or if the school district would
have been allowed to observe your child, an individual conducting an independent educational
assessment must also be allowed to observe your child in the classroom.
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
If the school district proposes a new school setting for your child and an independent
educational assessment is being conducted, the independent assessor must be allowed to first
observe the proposed new setting. (20 USC 1415[b][1] and [d][2][A]; 34 CFR 300.502; EC
56329[b] and [c])
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
Access to Educational Records
May I examine my child’s educational records?
You have a right to inspect and review all of your child’s education records without unnecessary
delay, including prior to a meeting about your child’s IEP or before a due process hearing. The
school district must provide you access to records and copies, if requested, within five (5)
business days after the request has been made orally or in writing. (EC 49060, 56043[n],
56501[b][3], and 56504)
How Disputes Are Resolved
Due Process Hearing
When is a due process hearing available?
You have the right to request an impartial due process hearing regarding the identification,
assessment, and educational placement of your child or the provision of FAPE. The request for
a due process hearing must be filed within two years from the date you knew or should have
known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process complaint. (20 USC
1415[b][6]; 34 CFR 300.507; EC 56501 and 56505[l])
Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution
May I request mediation or an alternative way to resolve the dispute?
A request for mediation may be made either before or after a request for a due process hearing
is made.
You may ask the school district to resolve disputes through mediation or alternative dispute
resolution (ADR), which is less adversarial than a due process hearing. The ADR and mediation
are voluntary methods of resolving a dispute and may not be used to delay your right to a due
process hearing.
What is a pre-hearing mediation conference?
You may seek resolution through mediation prior to filing a request for a due process hearing.
The conference is an informal proceeding conducted in a nonadversarial manner to resolve
issues relating to the identification, assessment, or educational placement of a child or to a
FAPE.
At the prehearing mediation conference, the parent or the school district may be accompanied
and advised by nonattorney representatives and may consult with an attorney prior to or
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
following the conference. However, requesting or participating in a prehearing mediation
conference is not a prerequisite to requesting a due process hearing.
All requests for a prehearing mediation conference shall be filed with the Superintendent. The
party initiating a prehearing mediation conference by filing a written request with the
Superintendent shall provide the other party to the mediation with a copy of the request at the
same time the request is filed.
The prehearing mediation conference shall be scheduled within fifteen (15) days of receipt by
the Superintendent of the request for mediation and shall be completed within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the request for mediation unless both parties agree to extend the time. If a
resolution is reached, the parties shall execute a legally binding written agreement that sets
forth the resolution. All discussions during the mediation process shall be confidential. All
prehearing mediation conferences shall be scheduled in a timely manner and held at a time and
place reasonably convenient to the parties. If the issues fail to be resolved to the satisfaction of
all parties, the party who requested the mediation conference has the option of filing for a due
process hearing. (EC 56500.3 and 56503)
Due Process Rights
What are my due process rights?
You have a right to:
1. Have a fair and impartial administrative hearing at the state level before a person who is
knowledgeable of the laws governing special education and administrative hearings (20
USC 1415[f][1][A], 1415[f][3][A]-[D]; 34 CFR 300.511; EC 56501[b][4])
2. Be accompanied and advised by an attorney and/or individuals who have knowledge about
children with disabilities (EC 56505 [e][1])
3. Present evidence, written arguments, and oral arguments (EC 56505[e][2])
4. Confront, cross-examine, and require witnesses to be present
(EC 56505[e][3])
5. Receive a written or, at the option of the parent, an electronic verbatim record of the
hearing, including findings of fact and decisions (EC 56505[e][4])
6. Have your child present at the hearing (EC 56501[c][1])
7. Have the hearing be open or closed to the public (EC 56501[c][2])
8. Receive a copy of all documents, including assessments completed by that date and
recommendations, and a list of witnesses and their general area of testimony within five (5)
business days before a hearing (EC 56505[e][7] and 56043[v])
9. Be informed by the other parties of the issues and their proposed resolution of the issues at
least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing (EC 56505[e][6])
10. Have an interpreter provided (CCR 3082[d])
11. Request an extension of the hearing timeline (EC 56505[f][3])
12. Have a mediation conference at any point during the due process hearing (EC 56501[b][2]),
and
13. Receive notice from the other party at least ten days prior to the hearing that the other party
intends to be represented by an attorney (EC 56507[a]). (20 USC 1415[e]; 34 CFR 300.506,
300.508, 300.512 and 300.515)
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
Filing a Written Due Process Complaint
How do I request a due process hearing?
You need to file a written request for a due process hearing. You or your representative needs
to submit the following information in your request:
1. Name of the child
2. Address of the residence of the child
3. Name of the school the child is attending
4. In the case of a homeless child, available contact information for the child and the name of
the school the child is attending, and
5. A description of the nature of the problem, including facts relating to the problem(s) and a
proposed resolution of the problem(s)
Federal and state laws require that either party filing for a due process hearing must provide a
copy of the written request to the other party. (20 USC 1415[b][7], 1415[c][2]; 34 CFR 300.508;
EC 56502[c][1])
Prior to filing for a due process hearing, the school district shall be provided the opportunity to
resolve the matter by convening a resolution session, which is a meeting between the parents
and the relevant members of the IEP team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in
the due process hearing request. (20 USC 1415[f][1][B]; 34 CFR 300.510)
What does a resolution session include?
Resolution sessions shall be convened within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice of
the parents’ due process hearing request. The sessions shall include a representative of the
school district who has decision-making authority and not include an attorney of the school
district unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney. The parent of the child may discuss
the due process hearing issue and the facts that form the basis of the due process hearing
request.
The resolution session is not required if the parent and the school district agree in writing to
waive the meeting. If the school district has not resolved the due process hearing issue within
thirty (30) days, the due process hearing may occur. If a resolution is reached, the parties shall
execute a legally binding agreement. (20 USC 1415[f][1][B]; 34 CFR 300.510)
Does my child’s placement change during the proceedings?
The child involved in any administrative or judicial proceeding must remain in the current
educational placement unless you and the school district agree on another arrangement.
If you are applying for initial admission of your child to a public school, your child will be placed
in a public school program with your consent until all proceedings are completed. (20 USC
1415[j]; 34 CFR 300.518; EC 56505[d])
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
May the decision be appealed?
The hearing decision is final and binding on both parties. Either party may appeal the hearing
decision by filing a civil action in state or federal court within 90 days of the final decision. (20
USC 1415[i][2] and [3][A], 1415[l]; 34 CFR 300.516; EC 56505[h] and [k], EC 56043[w])
Who pays for my attorneys’ fees?
In any action or proceeding regarding the due process hearing, the court, in its discretion, may
award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to you as parent of a child with a disability
if you are the prevailing party in the hearing. Reasonable attorneys’ fees may also be made
following the conclusion of the administrative hearing, with the agreement of the parties. (20
USC 1415[i][3][B]–[G]; 34 CFR 300.517; EC 56507[b])
Fees may be reduced if any of the following conditions prevail:
1. The court finds that you unreasonably delayed the final resolution of the controversy
2. The attorneys’ hourly fees exceed the prevailing rate in the community
for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, reputation, and experience
3. The time spent and legal services provided were excessive, or
4. Your attorney did not provide to the school district the appropriate information in the due
process request notice.
Attorneys’ fees will not be reduced, however, if the court finds that the State or the school
district unreasonably delayed the final resolution of the action or proceeding or that there was a
violation of this section of law. (20 USC 1415[i][3][B]-[G]; 34 CFR 300.517)
Attorneys’ fees relating to any meeting of the IEP team may not be awarded unless an IEP team
meeting is convened as a result of a due process hearing proceeding or judicial action.
Attorneys’ fees may also be denied if you reject a reasonable settlement offer made by the
district/public agency ten (10) days before the hearing begins and the hearing decision is not
more favorable than the offer of settlement. (20 USC 1415[i][3][B]–[G]; 34 CFR 300.517)

CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
School Discipline and Placement Procedures
for Students with Disabilities
School Discipline and Alternative Interim Educational Settings
May my child be suspended or expelled?
School personnel may consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when
determining whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability who
violates a code of student conduct from his or her setting to:
• An appropriate interim alternative education setting, another setting, or suspension for
not more than ten (10) consecutive school days, and
• Additional removals of not more than ten (10) consecutive school days in the same
school year for separate incidents of misconduct
What occurs after a removal of more than ten (10) days?
After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her current placement for ten (10)
school days in the same school year, during any subsequent days of removal the public agency
must provide services to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education
curriculum and progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child’s IEP. Also, a child will
receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention
services and modifications, which are designed to address the behavior violation so that it does
not recur.
If a child exceeds ten (10) days in such a placement, an IEP team meeting must be held to
determine whether the child’s misconduct is caused by the disability. This IEP team meeting
must take place immediately, if possible, or within ten (10) days of the school district’s decision
to take this type of disciplinary action.
As a parent you will be invited to participate as a member of this IEP team. The school district
may be required to develop an assessment plan to address the misconduct or, if your child has
a behavior intervention plan, review and modify the plan as necessary.
What happens if the IEP team determines that the misconduct is not caused by
the disability?
If the IEP team concludes that the misconduct was not a manifestation of the child’s disability,
the school district may take disciplinary action, such as expulsion, in the same manner as it
would for a child without a disability. (20 USC 1415[k][1] and [7]; 34 CFR 300.530)
If you disagree with the IEP team’s decision, you may request an expedited due process
hearing, which must occur within twenty (20) school days of the date on which you requested
the hearing. (20 USC 1415[k][2]; 34 CFR 300.531[c])
Regardless of the setting the school district must continue to provide FAPE for your child.
Alternative educational settings must allow the child to continue to participate in the general
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
curriculum and ensure continuation of services and modifications detailed in the IEP. (34 CFR
300.530; EC 48915.5[b])
Children Attending Private School
May students who are parentally placed in private schools participate in publicly
funded special education programs?
Children who are enrolled by their parents in private schools may participate in publicly funded
special education programs. The school district must consult with private schools and with
parents to determine the services that will be offered to private school students. Although school
districts have a clear responsibility to offer FAPE to students with disabilities, those children,
when placed by their parent in private schools, do not have the right to receive some
or all of the special education and related services necessary to provide FAPE. (20 USC
1415[a][10][A]; 34 CFR 300.137 and 300.138; EC 56173)
If a parent of an individual with exceptional needs who previously received special education
and related services under the authority of the school district enrolls the child in a private
elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the local
educational agency, the school district is not required to provide special education if the district
has made FAPE available. A court or a due process hearing officer may require the school
district to reimburse the parent or guardian for the cost of special education and the private
school only if the court or due process hearing officer finds that the school district had not made
FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment in the private elementary
school or secondary school and that the private placement is appropriate. (20 USC
1412[a][10][C]; 34 CFR 300.148; EC 56175)
When may reimbursement be reduced or denied?
The court or hearing officer may reduce or deny reimbursement if you did not make your child
available for an assessment upon notice from the school district before removing your child from
public school. You may also be denied reimbursement if you did not inform the school district
that you were rejecting the special education placement proposed by the school district,
including stating your concerns and intent to enroll your child in a private school at public
expense.
Your notice to the school district must be given either:
• At the most recent IEP team meeting you attended before removing your child from the
public school, or
• In writing to the school district at least ten (10) business days (including holidays) before
removing your child from the public school. (20 USC 1412[a][10][C]; 34 CFR 300.148;
EC 56176)
When may reimbursement not be reduced or denied?
CHAPTER 4
APPENDIX A
A court or hearing officer must not reduce or deny reimbursement to you if you failed to provide
written notice to the school district for any of the following reasons:
• The school prevented you from providing notice
• You had not received a copy of this Notice of Procedural Safeguards or otherwise been
informed of the requirement to notify the district
• Providing notice would likely have resulted in physical harm to your child
• Illiteracy and inability to write in English prevented you from providing notice, or
• Providing notice would likely have resulted in serious emotional harm to your child
(20 USC 1412[a] [10] [C]; 34 CFR 300.148; EC 56177)
State Complaint Procedures
When may I file a state compliance complaint?
You may file a state compliance complaint when you believe that a school district has violated
federal or state special education laws or regulations. Your written complaint must specify at
least one alleged violation of federal and state special education laws. The violation must have
occurred not more than one year prior to the date the complaint is received by the California
Department of Education (CDE). When filing a complaint, you must forward a copy of the
complaint to the school district at the same time you file a state compliance complaint with the
CDE. (34 CFR 300.151–153; 5 CCR 4600)
Complaints alleging violations of federal and state special education laws or regulations may be
mailed to:
California Department of Education

CONFIDENTIALITY OF PUPIL RECORDS
5.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) must establish policies, procedures and rights
related to confidentiality of pupil records. Policies and procedures must be consistent
with State and federal laws and regulations, including the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). Procedures describe the required notice to parents,
right to access pupil records, record keeping procedures, retention and descruction of
pupil records, and requests for amendment of pupil records.
5.2 PARENT RIGHT TO ACCESS
Parents have the right to inspect and review all education records that relate to their
child with respect to the identification, assessment, and educational placement of the
child and the provision of a free, appropriate public education, which are collected,
maintained, or used by agency.
Each agency shall permit parents access to records without unnecessary delay no more
than five (5) business days after the request has been made either orally or in writing.
This includes access to and confidentiality of public records including LEAs educating
pupils with disabilities in State hospitals, developmental centers, and youth and adult

facilities. The LEA may not charge a fee for retrieval of information. The agency may
charge a fee for copies of records, which are made for parents, if the fee does not
prevent the parents from exercising their right to inspect and review these records.
5.2.A Definition of Parent:
Natural parent; adoptive parent; legal guardian; child, the child himself (if of
legal age, 16 years or 18 years or completed tenth grade, depending upon the
purpose); or a surrogate parent who has been appointed. If the parents are
divorced or legally separated, only the parent having legal custody may
challenge the contents of a record, offer a written response to a challenged
record, or consent to the release of records to others, provided however, that
either parent may grant consent if both parents have notified, in writing, the
school or school district that such an agreement has been made. Both parents
have an unqualified right to see all materials in their child's file, unless there is a
court order the contrary.
5.2.B Definition of Access:
Access means a personal inspection and review of a record or an accurate copy
of a record, an oral description or communication of a record, or receipt of a
copy of a record.
5.3 NOTICE TO PARENTS
Parents must be notified, in writing, of their rights to inspect and review the school
records of their children. This must be done at the time of initial enrollment and
annually thereafter. Notice should be in their native language and include information
on policies, procedures, and rights related to record keeping icluding the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). The notice will contain the
following specific information:
• The types of records and information contained therein.
• The position of the official responsible for the maintenance of each type of record.
• The location of the log or record required to be maintained.
• Criteria used by the district to define “school officials and employees” and in
determining “legitimate educational interest.”
CHAPTER 5
- 3 - Reviewed July 2012
• The policies of the district for reviewing and expunging records.
• The right of the parent to access pupil records.
• The procedures for challenging the content of pupil records.
• The cost, if any, charged to the parent for reproducing copies of records.
• The categories of information which the institution has designated as directory
information.
• Any other rights stated in the California Education Code and the right to file a
complaint with Department of Health, Education and Welfare (FERPA).
• Notice of all locations where copies of the policies and procedures regarding the
General Education Provisions Act and confidential pupil records may be obtained.
The right to inspect and review also includes responses to reasonable requests for
explanations and interpretations of the records and the right to have a
representative of the parent inspect and review the records. (See provision
regarding written parental releases.)
5.3.A Recommended Procedure:
If a parent wishes to inspect school records, they complete and return “Parent
Request for Access to Pupil Records.” (Refer to sample on Page A-1.) When this
form is returned, it should be time/date stamped to show when it was received
by the school office. Enter program, dates of attendance, teacher and principal
on lower portion of form. Log date received, pupil name and program name in
the “Parent Access Request Log.” (Refer to sample on Page A-2.)
The request is given to a certificated staff member who interprets the records where
necessary. The certificated staff member schedules an appointment with the parent
within five business days and reviews the contents of the pupil’s folder with the
parent. If photocopies are requested, copy the requested material immediately if
possible. If not possible, mail to the parent within one or two days of the request.
The Request Form is filed in pupil’s folder.
Even though records from physicians may be stamped “Confidential” or a
psychologist’s report contains sensitive or potentially upsetting information, the
parent or eligible student has full rights of access. (EC 49061, 49063)
CHAPTER 5
- 4 - Reviewed July 2012
5.4. SAFEGUARDS
Agencies/districts must protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable information
at collection, storage, disclosure and destruction stages.
One official at each agency must assume responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality
of any personally identifiable information. All persons collecting or using personally
identifiable information must receive training or instruction regarding the state policies
and procedures as stated in the annual program plan.
Each agency must maintain for public inspection a current list of names and positions
of those employees who have access to personally identifiable information.
5.5. RELEASE OF INFORMATION FROM PUPIL RECORDS
5.5.A Release of Directory Information
(1) At the time of enrollment, and annually thereafter, parents must be given an
opportunity to sign an “Objection to Release of Directory Information” Form.
When the Form is returned by the parent to the school, the school must file it in
the pupil’s records.
(2) If the parents have not filed an objection, the following directory information
may be supplied to employers, prospective employers, representatives of the
news media, officials of public agencies and nonprofit agencies:
• Name • Degrees and awards received
• Address • Participation in officially recognized
• Telephone activities and sports
• Date & place of birth • Weight/height of members of athletic
• Major field of study teams
• Dates of attendance • Most recent public or private school
attended by student

5.5.B Release of Information Not Requiring Parent/Guardian Authorization
(1) The following categories of individuals and agencies are recognized as
maybe having a “legitimate educational interest” in the contents of a pupil’s
educational records, and if so, be granted access without written parental
consent:
• School officials, including teachers within the educational agency who have
a legitimate educational interest, and members of attendance review boards.
• Officials of other schools or school systems in which the student seeks or
intends to enroll.
• Authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States,
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, an administrative head of
an education agency, or by State Educational authorities.
• State and local officials or authorities to which such information is
specifically required to be reported or disclosed pursuant to State statute
adopted prior to November 19, 1974.
• Parents of pupils 18 years or older who are dependents as defined in the IRS
Code.
• Pupils 16 years or older or having completed the tenth grade who request
access.
• Education Code section 49076 also requires access without written parental
consent of any district attorney participating in or conducting a truancy
mediation program or in the prosecution of a truancy petition; a prosecuting
agency concerning the failure of a parent or guardian to comply with the
compulsory education law; a probation officer or district attorney for the
purpose of criminal investigation or investigation of a student who has been
declared a ward of the court or involving a condition of probation. However,
the federal government has stated that the release to such persons would be
a violation of federal law (FERPA). For that reason, before information is
released to such persons or agencies the District should require that a court
order be issued.

be destroyed when no longer needed for the purpose for which it is
conducted.
• Officials and employees of private schools or school systems where the
pupil is enrolled or intends to enroll. Upon such requests, the requester
must notify the parent of his right to receive a copy of the record and the
right to challenge the content of the record.
(2) A school district is not authorized to permit access to pupil records to any
person (except those specified above) without parental or eligible student
consent or under judicial order. Information concerning a student shall be
furnished in compliance with a court order. The school district shall make a
reasonable effort to notify the parent and the pupil in advance of such
compliance if lawfully possible within the requirements of the judicial order.

prohibited; however, information may be shared with other persons
within the educational institution obtaining access, as long as such
persons have a legitimate interest in the information.
(3) Whenever a pupil reaches the age of 18 years or is attending an
institution of post-secondary education, the permission or consent
required of, and the rights accorded to, the parents or guardian of the
pupil shall thereafter only be required of, and accorded to, the pupil.
(EC 49061, 49073, 49076)
5.6 LOG OF REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
All requests of individuals or agencies with the exceptions of “other school officials”
above and parents, must be recorded in a record or log of requests for information,
except for directory information recipients. The log or record must be open to the
inspection by a parent and the school officials or his designee responsible for the
maintenance of pupil records and to other school officials with legitimate educational
interests in the records, and to the Comptroller General of the United States, the
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and administrative head of an educational
agency as defined in PL 93-380, and state educational authorities as a means of auditing
the operation of the system.
The log or record must contain the following information: the name of the requesting
party and the legitimate interest of the party. The log should be kept with the student’s
educational records.
Recommended Procedure:
• Upon receipt of a written request for “directory” information from a group
authorized to receive it, check pupil folder for “objection to release” form. (If no
objection form is present, supply information). The law does not require logging
requests for directory information.
• If request is oral, verify identity of requester by calling back. If any doubt as to
identity of requester, require a request submitted in writing, on official letterhead.
• Upon receipt of a written request for information, ascertain whether or not it falls
into the authorized categories as defined in Section above. If it does, supply the
information as explained above. If it does not, log request and mail the requester an
Exchange of Information form accompanied by the form letter (Appendix A-3).
CHAPTER 5
- 8 - Reviewed July 2012
• When the Exchange of Information form is returned to you, supply information
together with transmittal letter (Appendix A-4). The law does not require logging of
requests accompanied by authorization.
(EC 49064)
5.7. AMENDMENT OF RECORDS
5.7.A Grounds for Amendment
If parents desire to challenge the content of pupil records, they must establish
that one of six specific grounds exists and provide a written request to correct or
remove the information to the superintendent.
Grounds for amendment include:
• Inaccurate information.
• Information is unsubstantiated personal conclusion or inference.
• Information is a conclusion or inference outside the observer’s area of
competence.
• Information is not based on personal observation
• Misleading information.
• Information in violation of the privacy or other right of the pupil.
(EC 49070)
5.7.B Hearing Procedures
• Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request a superintendent or
designee meets with the parent and the certificated employee who recorded
the information, if the employee is presently employed by the District.
• The superintendent may sustain or deny the allegations of the parent, either
permitting the record to stand or authorizing its removal and destruction.
• Within thirty (30) days the parent may file a written appeal to the governing
board if the parent is dissatisfied with the decision of the superintendent.
• Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such an appeal the governing board
must hold a closed hearing with the parent and with the teacher, if he or she
is still employed by the District. The Board’s decision is final. Records of the
hearing are confidential and are to be destroyed after one year unless further
legal action is pending.
CHAPTER 5
- 9 - Reviewed July 2012
• As an alternative, the superintendent and the governing board may convene
a hearing panel if the parent gives written consent to release the relevant
pupil’s records to the members of the panel.
• The hearing panel consists of the chairperson who is a school principal in a
school other than the one where the record is located, a certificated
employee appointed by the parent, and a parent, appointed by the
superintendent or the governing board, who is not acquainted with the
pupil.
• The hearing panel meets in closed session to hear from the parent and the
teacher who recorded the information, if available. The panel is provided
with copies of the record in question and makes written findings of fact and
a written decision.
• The findings of the panel are forwarded to the superintendent or the
governing board depending on who convened the panel.
• The proceedings of the panel may not be disclosed or discussed by panel
members except in their official capacity.
• If, as a result of the hearing, the agency does not agree with the parent, it
will inform the parent of the right to place in the child’s records a statement
commenting on the record or explaining any reasons they disagree with the
decision of the agency.
(EC 49070, 49071)
5.8. RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION OF PUPIL RECORDS
No pupil records may be destroyed except pursuant to established District rules and
regulations which must comply with the procedure for destruction of records contained
in California Code of Regulations, Title 5, sections 16020 and following, or as provided
in Education Code sections 49070 (b) and (c) relating to the destruction of records that
have been successfully challenged as inaccurate or unsubstantiated.
An agency may not destroy any educational record if there is an outstanding request to
inspect or review them. Logs or records of access must be maintained as long as the
educational record to which it pertains is maintained.
CHAPTER 5
- 10 - Reviewed July 2012
As documents are received by the records custodian at each site, he or she shall initial
them to indicate the type of records involved. There are three types of records:
mandatory permanent (MP), mandatory interim (MI), and permitted (P).
After records are classified, they must then be classified for destruction according to the
timelines contained in Title 5.
5.8.A Mandatory Permanent Records include:
• Legal name of pupil
• Date of birth
• Method of verification of date of birth
• Sex of pupil
• Place of birth
• Name and address of a parent of a minor pupil
1. Address of minor pupil if different
2. An annual verification of the name and address of the parent and
residence of the pupil
• Entering and leaving date for each school year and for any summer session
or other extra session
• Subjects taken during each year, half-year, summer session or quarter
• If marks or credits are given, the marks or number of credits toward
graduation allowed for work taken
• Verification of, or exemption from, required immunizations
• Date of high school graduation or equivalent
• Evidence of pupil's disability and participation in special education program,
if applicable
These mandatory permanent records must be forwarded to a requesting school,
but the original or copy must be retained permanently. This includes many
items in the cum file.
Mandatory Permanent Records that have been in inactive status for five years
shall be microfilmed.
(5CCR 430,432)
5.8.B Mandatory Interim Records are those records which schools are required to
compile and maintain for stipulated periods of time and are then destroyed
when usefulness ceases in accordance with Section 16027 of this title during the
third school year following such classification. These records must be
CHAPTER 5
- 11 - Reviewed July 2012
forwarded to all California schools and may be forwarded to other schools. Such
records include:
• Access log
• Health records
• Participation in special education programs including required tests, case
studies, authorizations and actions necessary to establish eligibility or
discharge
• Language training records
• Progress slips and/or notices as required by Education Code Sections 49066
and 49067
• Parental restrictions regarding access to directory information or related
stipulations
• Parent rejoinders to challenged records and to disciplinary action
• Parental authorizations or prohibitions of pupil participation in specific
programs
• Results of standardized tests administered within the preceding three years
(5CCR 430, 432)
5.8.C Permitted Records
• Objective counselor and/or teacher ratings
• Standardized test results older than three years
• Verified reports of relevant behavioral patterns
• All disciplinary notices
• Attendance records not covered in the California Code of Regulation, Title 5
section 400 (records related to ADA or to compulsory education)
NOTE: A confusing portion of the statute, the term “unless forwarded” language
appears to give the district the option of simply forwarding the file to the next school,
avoiding the issue of retention altogether. However, unless the school is another
California public school, districts should use the three year rule. If the new school is a
California public school the mandatory interim records could simply be forwarded on.
(5CCR 430, 432)
CHAPTER 5
- 12 - Reviewed July 2012
5.8.D Destruction Procedures
(1) Destruction of Permitted Records
Permitted pupil records may be destroyed when their usefulness ceases.
They may be destroyed after six months following the pupil’s completion
of or withdrawal from the educational program.
(5CCR 437)
(2) Destruction of Mandatory Interim Records
Unless forwarded to another district, mandatory interim pupil records
may be adjudged to be disposble when the student leaves the district or
when their usefulness ceases. Destruction shall occur during the third
school year following such classification.
Special Education Records fall into the middle category, “mandatory interim records”.
These records may be destroyed three years after the student leaves the district or three
years after “usefulness ceases”. The better practice is to destroy records only after the
student has been gone from the district for at least three years. If the student is with the
district for a long time then the term “usefulness” could be interpreted for a triennial
period, thereby making the holding period equal six years. This only applies to Special
Education Records, Mandatory Permanent records must be kept forever.
(5CCR 437)
5.9 CONFIDENTIALITY OF PUPIL RECORDS CONTAINING I.Q. INFORMATION
The following guidelines implement the California State Department of Education
Directives dated December 3, 1986, and October 15, 1987, regarding the use of I.Q. tests
in the assessment of African-American pupils for special education services.
As of September, 1986, school districts may not use intelligence tests in the assessment
of African-American pupils who have been referred for special education services. The
prohibition against using I.Q. tests for identifying or placing African-American pupils
in special education means that parents of African-American pupils shall not be asked if
they want to consent to the use of such tests. An I.Q. test may not be given to a African-
American pupil even with parental consent. There are no special education related
purposes for which I.Q. tests shall be administered.
CHAPTER 5
- 13 - Reviewed July 2012
5.9.A I.Q. Test Protocols
When a school district receives records containing I.Q. test protocols from other
agencies, out-of-state school districts, military facilities, or independent
assessors, these records shall be forwarded to the parent. I.Q. test scores
contained in the records shall not become a part of the pupil’s current school
record.
5.9.B Pre-existing records containing I.Q. scores or references to information from
I.Q. tests must be permanently sealed.
Before sealing the records of these students:
• The parents must be notified that the records will be sealed because of a
court decision which prohibits the use of intelligence tests for African-
American students for any purpose related to special education. (Appendix
A-7)
• A qualified professional (school psychologist) will identify appropriate data
contained in the student’s educational records that is an I.Q. score or
information that was obtained from or relates to an intelligence test.
• The school psychologist will seal all I.Q. related information as described
below.
• The school psychologist will purge the I.Q. related information from the
educational records. The remaining information will then become part of
the student’s educational record.
5.9.C Record Sealing Procedure
The school psychologist will place all I.Q. related information in an envelope
provided by the school district and seal the envelope. He/she will label the
outside of the envelope with the student’s name and a notation that the
envelope contains sealed educational records and may not be opened. The
outside of the envelope shall also indicate that the Director of Special Education
must be consulted for information concerning the contents of the envelope.
Sealed records must be maintained by the district for five years.

The sealing process must be completed before a student is reevaluated for
special education or transfers to a new district.

GUIDELINES
6.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this document is to define the specific processes and procedures
involved in determining a student’s need to receive special education and related
services. It is not meant to determine instructional setting or placement. Those
determinations are made by the IEP Team based on identified student needs.
The determination of eligibility must be based on the findings of a multi-disciplinary
assessment where no single test or single observer is the sole determining factor. The
IEP Team must assure that the student's academic needs cannot be met through
modifications of the regular education program and that the disability, even with
corrections and modifications, adversely affects the individual's educational
performance. The IEP Team must also assure that all areas of suspected disability have
been assessed. There shall be further documentation that race, cultural differences,
economic disadvantage, language background, limited school experience and poor
attendance are not primary contributing factors to the results of the assessment. The IEP
Team will determine eligibility, present levels of performance, areas of need and goals
that address each area of need. Goals and (objectives if required) will be supported by
appropriate services in the least restrictive environment as determined by the IEP Team
for the child to receive educational benefit.

6.2 PRIOR TO REFERRAL FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION
The Student Study Team, or the referring instructional personnel, shall document that
academic interventions and accommodations/modifications of the regular program and
research-based interventions have been attempted and that the results of those
strategies have not been effective in meeting the student's need for an appropriate
education. Students shall be referred for special education and related services only
after the resources of the regular education program have been considered and, where
appropriate, utilized.
6.3 REFERRAL

assessment process and shall be documented. When a verbal referral is
made, staff of the school district, special education local plan area, or
county office shall offer assistance to the individual in making a request
in writing, and shall assist the individual if the individual requests such
assistance.
(b) All school staff referrals shall be written and include:
(1) A brief reason for the referral.
(2) Documentation of the resources of the regular education program
that have been considered, modified, and when appropriate, the
results of intervention. This documentation shall not delay time lines
for completing the assessment plan or assessment.
6.4 ASSESSMENT
E.C. Sec. 56327: The personnel who assess the pupil shall prepare a written report, or
reports, as appropriate, of the results of each assessment. The report shall include, but
not be limited to, all the following:
(a) Whether the pupil may need special education and related services.
(b) The basis for making the determination.
(c) The relevant behavior noted during the observation of the pupil in an appropriate
setting.
(d) The relationship of that behavior to the pupil's academic and social functioning.
(e) The educationally relevant health and development, and medical findings, if any.

Severe Disabilities and Non-severe Disabilities
Students meeting eligibility under some of the above federal classifications are
considered to be severely disabled as follows:
6.5.A AUTISM (AUT): A severely disabling condition.
Definition:
C.C.R., Title 5, Sec. 3030
A pupil exhibits any combination of the following autistic-like behaviors, to
include but not be limited to:
(1) An inability to use oral language for appropriate

Autism means a developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and
nonverbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age
3 that adversely affects a child’s educational performance. Other
characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive
activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or
change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The
term does not apply if a child’s educational performance is adversely affected
primarily because the child has an emotional disturbance.

(2) Written expression
(3) Basic reading skills
(4) Reading comprehension
(5) Mathematics calculation

learning disabilities is entitled to special education and related services.
C.C.R. Tile 5, Sec. 3030
(j) A pupil has a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological
processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or
written, which may manifest itself in an impaired ability to listen, think,
speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations, and has a severe
discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement in one or more of
the academic areas specified in Section 56337(a) of the Education Code. For
the purpose of Section 3030(j):
(1) Basic psychological processes include attention, visual processing,
auditory processing, sensory-motor skills, and cognitive abilities
including association, conceptualization and expression.
(2) Intellectual ability includes both acquired learning and learning
potential and shall be determined by a systematic assessment of

eligibility for special education. In determining the existence of a
severe discrepancy, the individualized education program team
shall use the following procedures:
(A) When standardized tests are considered to be valid for a specific
pupil a severe discrepancy is demonstrated by: first, converting
into common standard scores, using a mean of 100 and a standard
deviation of 15, the achievement test score and the ability test score
to be compared; second, computing the difference between these
common standard scores; and third, comparing this computed
difference to the standard criterion which is the product of 1.5
multiplied by the standard deviation of the distribution of
computed differences of students taking these achievement and
ability tests. A computed difference which equals or exceeds this
standard criterion, adjusted by one standard error of measurement,
the adjustment not to exceed 4 common standard score points,
indicates a severe discrepancy when such discrepancy is
corroborated by other assessment data which may include other
tests, scales, instruments, observations, and work samples as
appropriate.
(B) When standardized tests are considered to be invalid for a specific
pupil, the discrepancy shall be measured by alternative means as
specified on the assessment plan.
(C) If the standardized tests do not reveal a severe discrepancy as
defined in subparagraphs (A) or (B) above, the individualized
education program team may find that a severe discrepancy does
exist, provided that the team documents in a written report that the
severe discrepancy between ability and achievement exists as a
result of a disorder in one or more basic psychological processes.
The report shall include a statement of the area, the degree, and the
basis and method used in determining the discrepancy. The report
shall contain information considered by the team, which shall
include, but not be limited to:
(1) Data obtained from standardized assessment instruments;
(2) Information provided by the parent;
(3) Information provided by the pupil’s present teacher;
(4) Evidence of the pupil’s performance in the regular and/or special
education classroom obtained from observations, work samples, and
group test scores;
(5) Consideration of the pupil’s age, particularly for young children;
CHAPTER 6

(6) Any additional relevant information; and
(7) The discrepancy shall not be primarily the result of limited school
experience or poor school attendance.
(8) The discrepancy shall not be due to limited English proficiency.
(9) The discrepancy shall not be due to lack of appropriate instruction in
reading and math.
C.F.R. 300.7 (10)
Specific learning disability is defined as follows:
(i) General. The term means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological
processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written,
that may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write,
spell, or to do mathematical calculations, including conditions such as perceptual
disabilities, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental
aphasia.
(ii) Disorders not included. The term does not include learning problems that are
primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities, of intellectual
disability, of emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic

IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES
Required Factors in Determining Eligibility
The IEP Team must verify that the following two requirements have
been met in order to state that a student is eligible for special education
as a child with a specific learning disability:
• There is a severe discrepancy between ability and achievement.
• There is documented evidence of a processing disorder in one or
more of the following areas:
• Attention
• Visual processing
• Auditory processing
• Sensory-motor skills
• Cognitive abilities including association, conceptualization, and
expression
CHAPTER 6
- 18 - Reviewed July 2012
NOTE: In order for the student to be eligible for special education
program and services the team must find that the student's needs cannot
be met in the regular program (including categorical services) without
special education support.
*Determination of a Severe Discrepancy
A multi-disciplinary team shall assess a student in one or more of the
following areas of academic instruction:
• Oral expression
• Listening comprehension
• Written expression
• Basic reading skills
• Reading comprehension
• Mathematics calculation
• Mathematics reasoning
• Reading fluency
A report written by a credentialed school psychologist shall document
that the pupil demonstrates a severe discrepancy between his ability and
achievement.
The determination of a severe discrepancy necessitates the use of a
standardized achievement test and a test of intellectual ability.
*NOTE: IDEA 2004 allows for LEAs or SEAs to implement a Response to
Intervention Model in lieu of the severe discrepancy model. However,
California has not established a process for districts to use RtI at this time. See
Chapter 15 for further information.
Additional Considerations:
The psychological processing disorder should be manifested on more than
one instrument and be corroborated by an analysis of other test results and
observations.
The relationship of the processing disorder to the pupil's academic
deficits should be clearly established and become the basis for
CHAPTER 6
- 19 - Reviewed July 2012
instructional planning and development of specific objectives for the
student's IEP.
The IEP Team shall ensure that neither the documented psychological
processing disorder nor the discrepancy is due to factors of environment,
cultural differences or economic disadvantage. Also, neither the
documented psychological processing disorder nor the discrepancy may
be the result of visual, hearing or motor disabilities, intellectual
disability, limited school experience or poor attendance, limited English
proficiency or lack of appropriate instruction in reading and math.

combination of public, private, home and hospital, or residential
settings.
(b) The individualized education program team shall document its
rationale for placement in other than the pupil's school and classroom
in which the pupil would otherwise attend if the pupil were not
disabled. The documentation shall indicate why the student’s disability
keeps his or her needs from being met in a less restrictive environment
even with the use of supplementary aids and services.
In determining the educational placement of a child with a disability, the district
will ensure that the placement decision is made by a group of persons, including
the parents, and other persons knowledgeable about the child, the meaning of
the evaluation data, and the placement options.
All placement decisions will be based on the individual need of the student
pursuant to the IEP and not on the basis of the disability, configuration of
service delivery, availability of staff, curriculum intent or administrative
experience. All placements will be made in the least restrictive environment.
The continuum of options include, but are not necessarily limited to all of the
following or any combination of the following:
1) Regular education classroom.
2) Regular education classroom with supplementary aids and
services.
3) Regular education classroom with resource specialist services
4) Regular education classroom with related services.
5) Regular education classroom with services from a special day
class teacher and supports and/or related services.
6) Special Classes and Centers.
7) Nonpublic, nonsectarian school services.
8) State special schools.
9) Residential Schools

INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM
7.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a written statement determined in a
meeting of the IEP team, including the parent, and developed for each child with a
disability.
The IEP will show a direct relationship between the present levels of academic
achievement and functional performance, any assessments, the student’s goals and
benchmarks, and the educational services to be provided.
7.2 INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM: PROCESS
7.2. A Development of the Individualized Education Program (IEP)
An IEP shall be developed within a total time not to exceed 60 calendar days,
not counting days between the student’s regular school sessions, terms, or
days of school vacation in excess of five school days, from the date of receipt
of the parent’s written consent for assessment.
A district administrator or designee will initiate and conduct the meeting for
the purpose of developing, reviewing, and revising the IEP of a child with a
disability.
All efforts will be made to ensure that one or both of the parents of a child,
with a disability, are present at each IEP meeting or are afforded the
opportunity to participate. The parent will be notified of the meeting early
CHAPTER 7

enough to ensure that they will have an opportunity to attend. The meeting
will be scheduled at a mutually agreed upon time and place.
When developing each student’s IEP, the IEP Team shall consider the
strengths of the child and the concerns of the parents for enhancing the
education of their child. The IEP Team will consider the results of the initial
or most recent evaluation of the child, and as appropriate, the results of the
child’s performance on any general State or district wide assessment program.

career education.
All service providers, the school site and any outside agencies that will provide services
will be given a copy of the IEP or be knowledgeable of its content.
7.7 REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE IEP
The IEP will be reviewed periodically, but not less than annually to determine whether
the annual goals for the child are being achieved. The IEP will be revised as appropriate
to address any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals and in the general
curriculum, where appropriate.
In addition, the IEP team will meet whenever the parent or teacher requests a meeting to

7.7. D Alternative Means of Meeting Participation
When conducting IEP Team meetings, the parent of the child with a disability
and the LEA may agree to use alternative means of meeting participation, such
as video conferences or conference calls.
7.8 INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM: CONSIDERATION OF SPECIAL
FACTORS
The IEP team will consider the following special factors:
7.8. A Positive Behavioral Interventions
In the case of a child whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of
others, consider, if appropriate, strategies, including positive behavioral
interventions, strategies, and supports to address that behavior.
7.8. B Students with Limited English Proficiency
In the case of a child with limited English proficiency, consider the language
needs of the child as those needs relate to the child’s IEP.
For individuals whose primary language is other than English, linguistically
appropriate goals, objectives, programs and services.
7.8. C Blind and Visually Impaired
In the case of a child who is blind or visually impaired, provide for instruction in
Braille and the use of Braille unless the IEP team determines that the use of
Braille is not appropriate for the child. The IEP team will make this decision
after an evaluation of the child’s reading and writing skills, needs and
appropriate reading and writing media (including an evaluation of the child’s
future needs for instruction in Braille or the use of Braille) is conducted.
7.8. D Deaf and Hearing Impaired
Consider the communication needs of the child, and in the case of a child who is
deaf or hard of hearing, consider the child’s language and communication needs.
CHAPTER 7
- 9 - Reviewed July 2012
The IEP team will consider opportunities for direct communication with peers
and professional personnel in the child’s language and communication mode,
academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct
instruction in the child’s language and communication mode.
7.8. E Assistive Technology
Consider whether a child requires assistive technology devices and services.
If, in considering the above special factors, the IEP team determines that a child
needs a particular device or service (including an intervention, accommodation,
or other program modification) in order for the child to receive a free and
appropriate public education, the IEP team must include a statement to that
effect in the child’s IEP.
Prior to determining the actual special education and related services, the IEP team
must discuss and document all options that were considered.
7.9 EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT
Board of Education v. Rowley 1982 was decisive in defining the term educational benefit.
The Supreme Court concluded that the IDEA does not require that LEAs maximize the
potential of students with disabilities. The intent of the IDEA was more to open the
door of public education to students with disabilities rather than guarantee any
particular level of education once inside.
7.9.A Components of Educational Benefit Analysis
Based on procedural requirements, including:
1. The assessment is complete and the child is assessed in all areas of
suspected disability.
2. The IEP team identifies needs related to:
 The child’s disability
 Involvement and progress in the general curriculum
3. Goals are established in each need area
 Objectives are developed for students taking CAA
4. Services are planned to support:
 Progress towards all goals
 Progress in the general curriculum
 Participation in the general education environment
 Education with other students with disabilities and typically
developing peers
5. The IEP team reviews the student’s progress and adjusts the IEP if
progress was not made or to address other needs.

provision of a functional vocational evaluation. (56345.1. (a))
If a participating agency (other than the district) fails to provide the transition
services described in the IEP, the IEP team will reconvene to identify alternative
strategies to meet the transition objectives for the student; and
If an invited agency representative cannot attend the IEP meeting to develop
transition services, the district will obtain agency participation in planning for
these services. Note: IDEA Regulations, added a requirement for consent prior
to inviting a representative of any participating agency likely to be responsible

7.13 SECONDARY TRANSITION
Transition services (designed with a results oriented process focused on
improving academic functional achievement of the student) must be addressed
CHAPTER 7

in the IEP of the student not later than in the year in which he/she turns 16 years
of age. The goal of transition services is planned movement from secondary
education to adult life that provides opportunities which maximize economic
and social independence in the least restrictive environment for individuals with
exceptional needs. Planning for transition from school to postsecondary
environments should begin in the school system well before the student leaves
the system. (30 EC 56460)
Transition is planning for a student’s future and how academic courses,
functional curriculum and vocational activities help move a student towards the
future goal. Discussion about transition or future planning should be addressed
at the beginning of the IEP team meeting so that the IEP team is focused
throughout the meeting on helping the student work towards his or her future
goals. The goal of transition is to provide the student with all the skills,
knowledge and support necessary to make their post school goals a reality.

CHAPTER 7
- 17 - Reviewed July 2012
If a participating agency (other than the district) fails to provide the
transition services described in the IEP, the IEP team will reconvene to
identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives for the
student.
If an invited agency representative cannot attend the IEP meeting to
develop transition services, the district will obtain agency participation in
planning for these services by some other means.
7.14 POST-SECONDARY GOALS
The IEP must document development of measurable postsecondary goals based
on age-appropriate transition assessments. The IEP for students 16 years old or
younger, if appropriate, must contain: appropriate measurable postsecondary
goals based upon age-appropriate transition assessments related to training,
education, employment, and, where appropriate, independent living skills; (bb)
the transition services (including courses of study) needed to assist the child in
reaching those goals. [Section 614(d) (1) (A) (i) (VIII)]
7.15 AREAS TO BE ADDRESSED
7.15.A Instruction
The IEP is an individualized instructional and support plan for students
with disabilities. The transition planning, activities and services detailed
in the IEP align instruction with student’s post-secondary goals.
7.15.B Related Services
The IEP must describe any related services the student may need, such as
transportation to a work experience or career counseling to help the
student prepare for his or her future goals.
7.15.C Community Experiences
Instructional activities may take place in the community such as
community based instruction to help students generalize the skills
learned in the classroom to the real world.
7.15.D Employment
All students should have employment related language in their IEP. For
some students this may be a goal to go to college; for others it may mean
job training or supported employment. Other students may go right to
CHAPTER 7
- 18 - Reviewed July 2012
work after leaving school. LEAs are responsible for helping students
identify their goals and develop plans that prepare students to achieve.
7.15.E Daily Living Skills and Functional Evaluation
Some students may need specific instruction and activities in order to
learn to take care of themselves and live as independently as possible.
Some students may need a functional evaluation to determine which
skills they will need to develop so that they are able to enter employment
or live independently.
7.16 TRANSFER OF RIGHTS AT AGE OF MAJORITY
The IDEA ’04 continues the requirement of notifying the student and family that
educational rights convert to the student upon reaching the age of majority,
which is 18 years old in California: beginning not later than 1 year before the
student reaches the age of majority under State law, a statement that the student
has been informed of his/her rights if any, that will transfer to the child on
reaching the age of majority. (Section 614(d) (1) (A) (i) (VIII), emphasis added)
7.17 POST-SECONDARY FOLLOW UP
The State requires districts to seek information from students who have
graduated from high school to collect data on post school outcomes.
See Appendix B
7.18 STUDENTS BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY-TWO YEARS
Between the ages of nineteen and twenty-one, inclusive; enrolled in or eligible
for a program under this part or other special education program prior to his or

C) Any person who becomes 22 years of age during the months of October,
November, or December while participating in a program under this act shall
be terminated from the program on December 31 of the current fiscal year,
unless the person would otherwise complete his or her individualized
education program at the end of the current fiscal year or unless the person
has not had an individual transition plan incorporated into his or her
individualized education program and implemented from the age of 20
years, in which case the person shall be terminated from the program at the
end of the fiscal year.
(E.C., Sec. 56026: (c) (4))
7.19 SUGGESTED TRANSITION AND EXIT GUIDELINES
Special education and related services is a service that may be short term or long term in
duration. It is an intervention designed to remediate deficits and address disabling
conditions that prevent success in regular education curriculum. The overall goal of
special education is to develop the skills necessary to successfully access the regular
education curriculum. This skill development, in conjunction with appropriate supports
and accommodations in the regular education program should establish a transition of
decreased special education services to increased regular education services. In some
cases, there may be a complete dismissal from special education. This transition and
dismissal addresses the least restrictive environment principle and practice, as required
of the IEP Team, which includes regular education staff when the child is currently in
regular education or is being considered for regular education.

- 1 - Revised July 2012
SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS
AND RELATED SERVICES
8.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The SELPA, or school district, will provide a continuum of program options to meet the
needs of students with disabilities to ensure a free appropriate public education (FAPE).
The IEP Team will select the program or combinations of programs that can meet the
student’s needs in the least restrictive environment (LRE), allowing for maximum
interaction with typically developing peers and course content consistent with
instruction provided to students without disabilities.
8.2 LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT
8.2. A Definition
To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated with
typically developing peers. Special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of
children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when
the nature of severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes
with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.
8.2. B Least Restrictive Environment Requirements
Least restrictive environment (LRE) requirements include the following:
(1) The child’s placement will be as close as possible to the child’s home.
CHAPTER 8
- 2 - Revised July 2012
(2) Unless the IEP requires some other arrangement, the child will be
educated in the school that he or she would attend if non-disabled.
(3) In selecting the least restrictive environment, consideration will be
given to any potential harmful effect on the child or on the quality of
services that she or he needs.
(4) A child with a disability will not be removed from education in ageappropriate
regular classrooms solely because of needed modifications
in the general curriculum.
(5) In providing or arranging for the provision of nonacademic and
extracurricular services and activities, the district will ensure that the
child with the disability participates with non-disabled children in
those services and activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the
needs of that child.
(6) Special classes may enroll a student only when the nature or severity of
the disability is such that education in the regular classes with the use
of supplementary aids and services, including curriculum modifications
and behavioral support, cannot be achieved satisfactorily. These
requirements also apply to separate schooling or other removal of
students from the regular education environment.
(EC 56364, 56364.2; 5 CCR 3042; CFR 300.550)
8.2.C. Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI)
Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) is defined as: “Adapting, as appropriate
to the needs of the child with a disability the content, methodology, or delivery
of instruction to ensure access of the child to the general curriculum, so that he or
she can meet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public
agency that apply to all children.” (34 CFR 300.26(b)(3)).
The California State Department of Education (CDE) made changes in the
2006/07 school year on how they report special education and related services.
Therefore, many districts are aligning their reporting system with the
requirements of the state. Moving to designating special education services as
specialized academic instruction moves districts away from labeling students
and allows more opportunities and flexibility for them when developing
services that meet their individual needs.
CHAPTER 8
- 3 - Revised July 2012
When districts adopt SAI there will no longer be separate designations by
program (i.e., resource specialist and SDC). The IEP will now say specialized
academic instruction. If a student’s IEP states that a student should receive SAI
in a separate class, delivered by a special education teacher, the services may
look similar to how they are currently but it wouldn’t be called a special day
class. Then they will decide if the services are provided in general education, in a
separate class, in a separate facility, or the community. Additionally, related
services will be listed as they have been previously.
The primary instructional service for most special education services will be
listed as Specialized Academic Instruction on Form 5A(2)of the IEP. Related
services will continue to be listed on form 5A(2). As specialized academic
instruction is identified, one must also identify the amount of service and the
location. A student may have more than one line for this service when the
locations are different. For example, you may have one line that indicates (SAI)
in general education for 10 hours a week, and another line that indicates (SAI) in
a separate class for 5 hours per week.
8.3 CONTINUUM OF PROGRAM OPTIONS
The continuum of options includes, but is not necessarily limited to, all of the following
or any combination of the following:
(a) Regular education classroom with accommodations as determined by
IEP.
(b) Regular education classroom with specialized academic instruction/
resource specialist services.
(c) Regular education classroom with specialized academic instruction or
related services.
(d) Regular education classroom with services from a special education
specialist/ special day class teacher and supports and/or related services.
8.3.A Special Classes and Centers
Instruction in settings other than classrooms where specially designed
instruction may occur.
Itinerant instruction in classrooms, resource rooms, and settings other than
classrooms where specially designed.
CHAPTER 8
- 4 - Revised July 2012
Instruction using telecommunication and instruction in the home, in hospitals,
and in other institutions.
8.3. B Nonpublic, Nonsectarian School Services.
Nonpublic, nonsectarian school means a private, nonsectarian school that
enrolls individuals with exceptional needs pursuant to an individualized
education program and is certified by the CDE.
8.3. C State Special Schools.
In determining the educational placement of a child with a disability, including a
preschool child, the district will ensure that the placement decision is made by a
group of persons, including the parents, and other persons knowledgeable about
the child, the meaning of the evaluation data, and the placement options.
All placement decisions will be based on the individual need of the student
pursuant to the IEP and not on the basis of the disability, configuration of service
delivery, availability of staff, curriculum intent or administrative experience. All
placements will be made in the least restrictive environment.
(EC 56360, 56361; CFR 300.551, 300.26)
8.3. D Related Services
The term "related services" means transportation, and such developmental,
corrective, and other supportive services (including speech-language
pathology and audiology services, interpreting services, psychological
services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, including therapeutic
recreation, social work services, school nurse services designed to enable an
individual with exceptional needs to receive a free appropriate public
education as described in the individualized education program of the child,
counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and
mobility services, and medical services, except that such medical services shall
be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only) as may be required to assist an
individual with exceptional needs to benefit from special education, and
includes the early identification and assessment of disabling conditions in
children.

CHAPTER 8
APPENDIX A
SANTA CLARA COUNTY SELPA
“EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES”
GUIDELINES
Santa Clara County SELPA member LEAs are committed to meeting the social, emotional and
academic needs of students in their schools. The following guidelines will assist IEP teams in
determining when “educationally related mental health services” are necessary for the student to
receive educational benefit. The below guidelines are intended to be a general overview of
mental health procedures. Each student is unique and therefore all procedures may not strictly
apply to all cases.
The IEP team makes the determination if a student’s social-emotional symptoms and/or related behavioral
presentation impede his/her learning or the learning of others. It is also the responsibility of the IEP team
or SST to ensure that all appropriate behavior interventions and pre-referral counseling have been fully
implemented. School-based interventions can include such things as school-wide behavior supports,
individual counseling, group counseling and character education. IEP based interventions can include
such things as behavior specialist consultation/support services, pragmatics or social skill instruction, DIS
psychological counseling, Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA), and/or Behavior Intervention Plan
(BIP) development/review.
Definition
“Educationally related mental health services” are identified as social/emotional and behavioral
services required for a student to receive educational benefit from his/her special education
program and services. These services may include: individual and group counseling, counseling
and guidance, parent counseling, social work services, psychological services, behavior
intervention services, intensive support services and residential treatment services.
Assessing and Determining Needs for “Educationally Related Mental Health Services”
• IEP teams should determine whether a student requires the related service of
“educationally related mental health services” using the same general process used to
determine the need for other related services. Students with IEPs are eligible for
“educationally related mental health services” as a related service if the student’s IEP
team determines that “educationally related mental health services” are needed in order
for the student to receive educational benefit. The IEP team determines what special
21
CHAPTER 8
APPENDIX A
education and related services are needed for the student to receive a free appropriate,
public education in the least restrictive environment. This determination should be based
on evaluative data. Such evaluative data may include formal assessments and evaluative
testing, observations of the student in his/her environment, information from records,
student/parent/provider interviews, and actual student performance. The method used
will depend upon the individual student and circumstances. Regardless of the method
used, IEP teams must be provided adequate information to determine the needs of a
student and the type, frequency and duration of services necessary to meet those needs. In
general, the assessment process for educationally related mental health services is the
same as the process used to determine a student’s needs in any other area of educational
functioning. .
Following are examples of relevant data an assessment may collect:
• Input from student, teachers, parents or other providers through standardized testing
and/or interview;
• History of absence or tardiness, truancy, detentions, discipline referrals, etc.;
• Hospitalization history and documentation;
• Observation of student;
• History with law enforcement or social services agencies;
• Other medical/educational information contained in a student’s education files.
The IEP team should analyze and document that the student’s current functioning, including
cognitive functioning, is at a level sufficient to enable the student to benefit from educationally
related mental health services (not including consultation services), and that the student exhibits
emotional or behavioral characteristics or symptoms that:
• Are observed by, or reported to, qualified educational staff, that occurs in educational and
other settings, as appropriate.
• Impede the student from benefiting from education services.
• Are identified as significant, as indicated by their rate of occurrence, intensity and
duration
• Are associated with a condition that cannot be described solely as a temporary adjustment
problem.
Typically, the IEP team should systematically design, implement and review a behavior
intervention plan prior to providing educationally-related mental health services. However,
under some circumstances, a behavior intervention plan may not have been developed prior to
the determination of the student’s need for “educationally related mental health” services.
22
CHAPTER 8
APPENDIX A
The IEP team has gathered data to support the implementation of behavioral and
social/emotional practices to determine that less restrictive supports in the school setting are
insufficient to provide educational benefit and that related services are necessary to provide the
student with educational benefit in the least restrictive environment.
Goal Development
The student’s needs are identified by the IEP team using assessment data. Goals must be
developed for every identified area of need, including the needs for which educationally related
mental health services may be required. Goals must be observable, measureable and
educationally relevant. Progress reporting on goals must be on a regular basis, as identified by
the student’s IEP team.
Students Requiring “Educationally Related Mental Health Services”
The IEP team determines that a student needs “educationally related mental health services”
when the student has significant needs identified through assessment by qualified school
personnel in the areas of social-emotional or social-behavioral functioning. In addition, the
student must have a current IEP, and the IEP should contain behavior goal(s) or a behavior
intervention plan which has been appropriately implemented. In exceptional circumstances,
some students’ IEPs may not contain behavior goals or a behavior intervention plan prior to a
recommendation for educationally related mental health services. Students eligible for
“educationally related mental health services” are not just those identified as having an
emotional disturbance. However, the IEP team should consider reassessing the basis for
eligibility if more intensive services are being considered and a student has not previously been
eligible under the category of emotional disturbance. Students can be anywhere on the
continuum of placement and services, as long as their present levels and current baselines
indicate a need for a social/emotional or behavioral goal, positive behavior plan, and
“educationally related mental health services”. The doctrine of least restrictive environment
applied to educationally-related mental health services and best practices support, where
appropriate, a tiered approach where lower level interventions have been implemented and that
the data/observations collected indicate that a higher, more intensive level of support services is
needed.
23
CHAPTER 8
APPENDIX A
When should an IEP team recommend a student for more intensive mental health related
services?
After fully implementing the IEP and determining a student is not receiving appropriate
educational benefit from the special education and related services on his/her IEP due to mental
health needs, the IEP team should consider more intensive “educationally related mental health
services”. IEP teams must clearly document the suspected/identified need related to mental
health and any recommendation for “educationally related mental health services” utilizing data
and information collected from sources such as various lower level interventions,
implementation of the BIP, Functional Behavioral Assessments, current scores on standardized
behavior rating scales observations, IEP team member input and the student’s present levels of
functioning. Subsequent to the IEP team recommendation, qualified educational personnel
should validate and compile the following information:
• A narrative summary describing the student’s current mental health needs, the specific
lack of appropriate educational progress and how this impacts educational performance in
the school setting, a description of the pre-referral counseling, psychological, and/or
guidance services, if any, and why the IEP team has determined that the services do/do
not meet the student’s current educational needs. Or, in cases where these services are
clearly inappropriate, the IEP team has documented which of these of the less restrictive
services were considered and why they were determined to be inadequate [including, but
not limited to, significant history of private psychological/psychiatric care (chronic)
and/or hospitalizations (acute) that have clearly impacted educational performance.
• A recommendation for each related service being considered by the IEP team including
duration and frequency
• A current psycho-educational evaluation report completed within an appropriate period of
time prior to the IEP team recommendation.
• Current IEP
• Data or evidence describing the full implementation of the BIP and/or the student’s
progress on the behavior goal(s)
• A Functional Behavior Analysis, if appropriate, has been completed
A student who is in the process of being evaluated and suspected of being eligible for special
education may require more intensive “educationally related mental health services”. Similar to
the above requirements, the initial assessment team must clearly document the
suspected/identified need related to mental health and the recommendation for assessment for
24
CHAPTER 8
APPENDIX A
more intensive “educationally related mental health services”. Qualified school personnel should
validate and compile the above mentioned information as it becomes available, and, most
importantly, a comprehensive narrative describing the need for evaluation.
Strong Collegial Collaboration
Counseling should not occur in isolation. It is crucial that counselors be trained to create strong
collegial linkages based on the needs of their students. Whether the student is at the elementary,
middle school or high school level it is important to have on-going communication with those
staff persons that are most involved with the student such as, the classroom teacher, school
psychologist, case manager, school principal or assistant principal. Some of the issues that
warrant on-going communication include, but are not limited to the following:
- Disciplinary actions
- Grades
- Scheduling for services and scheduling of classes
- Interpersonal strengths/weaknesses
- Follow-up relative to counseling goal
- Knowledge of traumatic event in student’s life (confidentiality)
“Educationally Related Mental Health Services” Needs
“Educationally related mental health services” are recommended and agreed upon at the IEP
team meeting if the team determines these services are necessary for the student to access and
benefit from his/her education program. The “educationally related mental health services” must
have an educational purpose and must be directed toward helping the student meet his/her goals
and progress in the general curriculum. Data from measurable goals should be used when
possible to determine whether the “educationally related mental health services” have
contributed toward improved educational success. These services must also be provided in the
least restrictive environment. “Educationally related mental health services” should therefore be
provided on a school campus whenever possible. It is the responsibility of the provider of the
service to ensure compliance with all confidentiality laws and regulations.
Service Locations
Comprehensive campus
When “educationally related mental health services” are provided on a comprehensive campus,
the service provider will discuss space requirements with the site administrator who is
responsible to arrange for appropriate space availability. For services requiring confidentiality, a
private room that will provide the student needed confidentiality and reliability in service
provision will be available to the provider on a regular basis.
25
CHAPTER 8
APPENDIX A
Students requiring services not available on a comprehensive school campus
When a student’s needs are deemed beyond the capacity of a comprehensive campus and
alternative settings are under consideration for the student, the IEP team should document the
team’s attempts to address the behavior and/or social emotional concerns in the least restrictive
environment. All efforts must be made to address the student’s needs within the continuum of
services within the LEA (including SELPA regional programs) prior to consideration of
residential and/or nonpublic school attendance.
Just as in any review of LRE and services, it must be evident that, outside of crisis intervention,
the student’s needs exceed the current supports and services. Therefore, it is vital to review
student’s related services, attendance, medication compliance (if applicable), educational
environmental supports, and current eligibility status.
Due to the severity of a student’s needs, it may be necessary for the IEP team to consider
residential and/or non-public school to address the student’s educational needs. When this is the
case, it is required that the appropriateness of all LRE options relating to the continuum of
services have been considered. In general, the IEP team will determine appropriate placement in
the least restrictive environment based on a student’s unique needs as determined by, among
others, present levels of performance, service provider recommendation, and
recommended/adjusted goals.
Confidentiality
Educationally related mental health service records prepared by LEA personnel or LEA
contractors will typically be subject to the confidentiality requirements of the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). However, depending on the circumstances, mental health
records in the possession of an LEA or a provider of school-based mental health services may, in
addition to FERPA, be governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPPA); the California Education Code (see, e.g., sections 49060 through 49079); the
California Civil Code (see, e.g., sections 56-56.37; and/or the California Welfare and Institutions
Code (see, e.g., sections 5328-5329). Each LEA and provider of school-based mental health
services shall be responsible to determine the confidentiality requirements applicable to each
student’s school-based mental health service records and each LEA shall develop and implement
processes to ensure that the confidentiality of these records is maintained in compliance with
these requirements.
26
CHAPTER 8
APPENDIX A
Exit Criteria
When a student’s functioning stabilizes, as demonstrated by consistent goal achievement, general
adaptive functioning improvement and stabilization, as well as academic progress; student will
be reassessed for continued need or modification to “Educationally Related Mental Health
Services”. As with any IEP service, recommendations for changes to or exit from services are
made by a student’s IEP team.

SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION DUE PROCESS
9.1 Discipline
A student identified as an individual with disabilities pursuant to IDEA and 504 is
subject to the same grounds for suspension and expulsion which apply to students
without disabilities.
A student with a disability can be expelled for violation of school conduct codes only
when certain procedural safeguards are followed.
If an action is contemplated regarding behavior resulting in consideration for expulsion
or involving a removal that constitutes a change of placement, the parents must be
notified of that decision no later than the date on which the decision to take that action is
made.
Immediately, if possible, but in no case later than 10 school days after the date on which
the decision to take that action is made, the IEP team must meet to review the
relationship between the child’s disability and the behavior subject to the disciplinary
action.
9.2 Suspension
The superintendent or designee may suspend a student with a disability for up to 5
consecutive school days for a single incident of misconduct and up to 20 school days in
a school year. However an additional 10 days is allowed for reassignment for purposes
of readjustment.
CHAPTER 9
- 2 -
The principal or designee shall monitor the number of days, including portions of days
that students with valid IEPs have been suspended during the school year.
9.3 Services during Suspension
Students suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year shall continue to
receive services, during the period of suspension, to enable the child to participate in the
general curriculum and to progress toward meeting the goals in the student’s IEP, as
determined by appropriate school personnel, in consultation with the teacher.
9.4 Transportation during Suspension
If the student with disabilities is excluded from school bus transportation, the student is
entitled to be provided with an alternative form of transportation at no cost to the
student or parent/guardian, provided that transportation is specified on the IEP.
9.5 Procedural Safeguards
The following procedural safeguards shall apply when a student is suspended for more
than 10 cumulative school days, when a student is placed in an interim alternative
educational setting (IAES), or when a change of placement is contemplated.
Not later than the date on which the decision to take action is made, the
parents/guardians of the student shall be notified of the decision and provided the
procedural safeguards notice.
9.6 Manifestation Determination
Within 10 school days of any decision to change the placement of a child with a
disability, because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and
relevant members of the IEP Team (as determined by the parent and the LEA) shall
review all relevant information in the student’s file, including the child’s IEP, any
teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents to
determine:
(1) if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and substantial
relationship to the child’s disability; or
(2) if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA’s failure to
implement the IEP.
If the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the IEP Team determine that either of
the above is applicable for the child, the conduct shall be determined to be a
manifestation of the child’s disability.
CHAPTER 9
- 3 -
9.6.A Determination that Behavior was a Manifestation
In determining that the behavior was a manifestation of the child’s disability, the
IEP Team must:
(1) Conduct a functional behavioral assessment,
and implement a behavioral intervention plan
for the child, provided that the LEA had not
conducted such assessment prior to such
determination before the behavior resulted in
change of placement.
(2) In the situation where a behavioral intervention
plan has been developed, review behavioral intervention plan if
the child has such a behavioral plan, and modify it, as necessary,
to address the behavior; and
(3) Except under special circumstances, return the child to the
placement from which the child was removed, unless the parent
and the LEA agree to a change of placement as part of the
modification of the behavioral intervention plan.
9.6. B Determination that Behavior was NOT a Manifestation of the Disability
If the team determines that the behavior was not a manifestation of the
disability:
(1) Student must continue to receive services to
enable the student to participate in the general
curriculum and to progress toward meeting
the goals in the student’s IEP.
(2) If appropriate, receive a functional behavioral
assessment, behavior intervention services and
modifications that are designed to address the
behavior violation so that it does not recur.
(3) District should continue through the expulsion process. Change
of placement to alternative setting for duration of the expulsion
process and decision is finalized.
(Refer to Chapter 16 for Manifestation Determination Form)
CHAPTER 9
- 4 -
9.7 45–day Removal to IAES (Special Circumstances)

The ALJ shall hear, and make determination regarding an appeal request. In making the
determination, the ALJ may order a change in placement of a child with a disability. In
such situations, the ALJ may:
(1) Return the child with a disability to the placement from which the child
was removed; or
(2) Order a change in placement of a child with a disability to an appropriate
interim alternative educational setting for not more than 45 days, if the
hearing officer determines that maintaining the current placement of
such child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to
others.
9.13 Protections for Children Not Yet Eligible for Special Education and Related Services
A child who has not been determined to be eligible for special education and related
services and who has engaged in behavior that violates a code of student conduct, may
assert any of the protections provided for in this part if the LEA had knowledge that the
child was a child with a disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary
action occurred.
9.13.A Basis of Knowledge
A LEA shall be deemed to have knowledge that a child is a child with a
disability if, before the behavior precipitated the disciplinary action occurred:
(1) The parent of the child has expressed concern in writing to
supervisory or administrative personnel of the appropriate
CHAPTER 9
- 6 -
educational agency, or a teacher of the child, that the child
is in need of special education and related services.
(2) The parent of the child has requested an evaluation of the child.
(3) The teacher of the child, or other personnel of the LEA, has
expressed specific concerns about a pattern of behavior
demonstrated by the child, directly to the director of special
education of such agency or to other supervisory personnel of the
agency.
9.13.B Exception
An LEA shall not have been deemed to have knowledge that the child is a child with a
disability if the parent of the child has not allowed an evaluation of the child or has
refused services if the child has been evaluated and it was determined that the child was
not a child with a disability.
9.14 Conditions that Apply if No Basis of Knowledge
(1) If a LEA does not have knowledge that a child is a child with a disability prior to
taking disciplinary measures against the child, the child may be subjected to
disciplinary measures applied to children without disabilities, who engage in
comparable behaviors.
(2) If a request is made for an evaluation of a child during the time period in which the
child is subjected to disciplinary measures, the evaluation shall be conducted in an
expedited manner. If the child is determined to be a child with a disability, taking
into consideration information from the evaluation conducted by the LEA and
information provided by the parents, the LEA shall provide special education and
related services. Pending the results, the child shall remain in the educational
placement determined by school authorities.

11.1 NON-PUBLIC School/Agency Placement Process
Before a district, special education local plan area, or county office places a student with
a disability in, or refers a student to, a NON-PUBLIC, nonsectarian school, the district,
special education local plan area, or county office shall initiate and conduct a meeting to
develop an individualized education program.
The IEP Team may recommend a NON-PUBLIC school placement when a public school
placement cannot be identified, which will appropriately implement the IEP. The IEP
Team shall take steps to find an appropriate special education and/or related service
placement in a public program operated by another local public education agency or the
county superintendent of schools. Following determination by the IEP Team that the
student requires NON-PUBLIC school placement, the school district shall, in
consultation with the parents and other public agencies, which may have financial
responsibilities for the placement of the individual, select one or more NON-PUBLIC
schools to determine which can implement the student’s IEP.
(EC 56342)
11.2 Out-of-State NON-PUBLIC Placements
Before contracting with a NON-PUBLIC, nonsectarian school or agency outside of this
state, the district, special education local plan area, or county office shall document its
efforts to utilize public schools or to locate an appropriate NON-PUBLIC, nonsectarian
school or agency program, or both, within the state.
CHAPTER 11

If a school district, special education local plan area, or county office of education decides
to place a student with a NON-PUBLIC, nonsectarian school or agency outside of this
state, the LEA shall indicate the anticipated date for the return of the student to a public
or NON-PUBLIC, nonsectarian school or agency placement, or a combination thereof,
located in the state and shall document efforts during the previous placement year to
return the student.
If a district, special education local plan area, or county office places a pupil with a NONPUBLIC,
nonsectarian school or agency outside of this state, the pupil's individualized
education program team shall submit a report to the California Department of
Education within 15 days of the placement decision. The report shall include information
about the special education and related services provided by the out-of-state program
placement and the costs of the special education and related services provided, and shall
indicate the efforts of the local educational agency to locate an appropriate public school
or NON-PUBLIC, nonsectarian school or agency, or a combination thereof, within the

pupil, who may transfer to the high school district.
When a student with a disability meets local educational agency requirements for
completion of a prescribed course of study and adopted differential proficiency
standards, as designated in the student’s IEP, the LEA, which developed the IEP, shall
award the diploma.
11.4 Initiation of Service Contract/Individual Service Agreement
The Master Contract shall specify the general administrative and financial agreements,
including teacher-to-pupil ratios, between the NPS and the LEA to provide the special
education and related services, as well as transportation specified in each student’s IEP.
The administrative provisions of the contract also shall include procedures for
recordkeeping and documentation, and the maintenance of school records by the
contracting local educational agency to ensure that appropriate high school graduation
credit is received by each pupil. The contract may allow for partial or full-time
attendance at the NPS.
The master contract shall include an individual services agreement for each student
placed by a LEA that will be negotiated for the length of time for which the NPS special
education and designated instruction and services are specified in the student’s IEP.
CHAPTER 11
- 3 - Reviewed July 2012
(1) The master contract shall include a description of the process being utilized
by the LEA to oversee and evaluate placements in NON-PUBLIC schools,
as required by federal law. This description shall include a method for
evaluating whether each student is making appropriate educational progress. At
least once every year, the LEA shall do all of the following and, to the extent
possible, the following shall be conducted as part of the development and
provision of an IEP:
(a) Evaluate the educational progress of each student placed in a NPS
including all state assessment results;
(b) Consider whether or not the needs of the student continue to be best
met at the NPS and whether changes to the IEP of the student are
necessary, including whether the student may be transitioned to a
public school setting. This consideration shall be made at an IEP
Team meeting;
(c) Changes in educational instruction, services, or placement provided
under contract may only be made on the basis of revisions to a
student's IEP. At any time during the term of the contract or
individual services agreement, the parent, the NPS, or the LEA may
request a review of a student's IEP by the individualized education
program team;
(d) Changes in the administrative or financial agreements of the master
contract that do not alter the individual services agreement that
outlines each student's educational instruction, services, or
placement may be made at any time during the term of the contract
as mutually agreed by the NPS and the LEA.
(e) The master contract or individual services agreement may be
terminated for cause. The cause shall not be the availability of a
public class initiated during the period of the contract unless the
parent agrees to the transfer of the student to a public school
program. To terminate the contract either party shall give 20 days'
notice;
(f) The NPS shall provide all services specified in an IEP, unless the
NPS, and the LEA agree otherwise in the contract or individual
services agreement;
(g) Related services provided pursuant to a NPS master contract shall
only be provided during the period of a student's regular or
extended school year program, or both, unless otherwise specified
by the student's IEP;
(h) The NPS shall report attendance of students receiving special
education and related services;
(i) A NPS is subject to the alternative accountability system in the same
manner as public schools and each student placed in the NPS shall
CHAPTER 11
- 4 - Reviewed July 2012
be tested by qualified staff of the NPS in accordance with that
accountability program. The test results shall be reported by the
NPS to the department;
(j) Beginning with the 2014-15 school year testing cycle, each NPS shall
determine its CAASPP testing period. The NPS shall determine this
period based on completion of 85 percent of the instructional year at
that NPS, plus and minus 10 days, resulting in a 21-day period.
Each NPS shall notify the district of residence of a student
enrolled in the school of its testing period. Staff at the NPS who
administer the assessments shall attend the regular testing training
sessions provided by the district of residence. If staff from a NPS
have received training from one LEA, that training will be sufficient
for all LEAs that send student to the NPS. The district
of residence shall order testing materials for its students that have
been placed in the NPS. The board shall adopt regulations to
facilitate the distribution of and collection of testing materials;
(k) The NPS shall prepare a school accountability report
card;
(l) The master contract or individual services agreement shall not

contract or individual services agreement, the LEA shall issue a warrant, upon
submission of an attendance report and claim, for an amount equal to the number of
creditable days of attendance at the per diem tuition rate agreed upon prior to the
enrollment of the pupil. This provision shall be allowed for 90 days during which time
the contract shall be consummated.
If after 60 days the master contract or individual services agreement has not been
finalized either party may appeal to the county superintendent of schools, if the county
superintendent is not participating in the local plan involved in the NON-PUBLIC,
nonsectarian school or agency contract, or the superintendent, if the county
superintendent is participating in the local plan involved in the contract, to negotiate the
contract. Within 30 days of receipt of this appeal, the county superintendent or the
superintendent, or his or her designee, shall mediate the formulation of a contract,
which shall be binding upon both parties.
A master contract for special education and related services provided by a NONPUBLIC,
nonsectarian school or agency may not be authorized under this part, unless
the school or agency has been certified as meeting those standards relating to the
CHAPTER 11
- 5 - Reviewed July 2012
required special education and specified related services and facilities for individuals
with exceptional needs. The certification shall result in the school or agency receiving
approval to educate pupils under this part for a period no longer than 18 months from
the date of the initial approval.
When written parental consent to the placement has been obtained, the authorized
representative of the student’s district of residence is responsible for initiating contract
negotiations with the NON-PUBLIC school, agency or institution. The following
provisions appear in Education Code 56366:
• The contract shall specify the administrative and financial agreements
between the NON-PUBLIC school and the district, SELPA or county office to
provide the services included in the pupil’s IEP. The rates determined at that
time shall not be increased for the duration of the contract unless mutually
agreed upon by both parties. The contract may allow for partial or full-time
attendance at the NON-PUBLIC school. The administrative provisions shall
include procedures for record keeping and documentation and the
maintenance of school records by the contracting district, SELPA, or county
office to insure that appropriate high school graduation credit is received by
the pupil.
• The contract shall be negotiated for the length of time for which NONPUBLIC
school services are specified in the pupil’s IEP.
• Changes in educational instruction, services or placement provided under
contract may only be made on the basis of revisions to the student’s IEP.
• The contract may be terminated for cause. Such cause shall not be the
availability of a public class initiated during the period of the contract, unless
the parent agrees to the transfer of the pupil to a public school program. To
terminate the contract, either party shall give 20 days notice.
• The NON-PUBLIC school shall provide all services specified in the IEP,
unless the NON-PUBLIC school and the district, SELPA, or county office
agrees otherwise in the contract.
• All districts, SELPAs, and county office will use an “Individual Agreement
for NON-PUBLIC, Nonsectarian School Agency Services” that has been
approved by the State.

11.5 PROGRESS REPORTS
As specified in the original contract agreement, the NON-PUBLIC school shall provide
written reports of the educational progress of individuals placed in the school.
The contractual services agreement between the educational agency and the NONPUBLIC
school agency follows the State Master Contract form (Santa Clara County
Approved Format) and includes the following terms and conditions pertaining to pupil
progress evaluation:
• The NON-PUBLIC school is required to comply with all elements of the student’s
IEP.
• The NON-PUBLIC school is required to provide the IEP Team with written
behaviorally specific and/or performance-based documentation of its compliance
with all elements of the IEP.
• The local district is required to review, at least annually, the student’s IEP and to
assess and evaluate the educational progress of each student placed in NONPUBLIC
school.
• The NON-PUBLIC school shall comply with Education Code section 48911.5,
which requires the NPS site principal to have the same duties and
responsibilities with respect to the suspension of pupils with previously
identified exceptional needs as set forth in section 48911.
• The NON-PUBLIC school is required to allow representatives of the contracting
educational agency to monitor, assess, and verify pupil progress through site
visits conducted at reasonable intervals.
11.6 TRANSPORTATION OF STUDENTS
The IEP Team determines whether transportation to and from the NON-PUBLIC school
is required as part of the student’s IEP. The local district may provide transportation or
may reimburse the parent or NON-PUBLIC school subject to a written agreement or
contract for cost of actual and necessary travel incurred in transporting the individual
with special needs at a rate to be determined by the public education agency governing
board. The rate shall be no less than the rate allowed for travel by the public education
agency employees.
Special education transportation services included in the NPS contract may not be
provided through the use of equipment owned or leased by a district, SELPA, or county
office unless through a waiver under Education Code Section 56366. The request for
CHAPTER 11
- 7 - Reviewed July 2012
waiver will include information and assurances that the use of the equipment owned or
leased by the contracting agency costs less than equipment of a private vendor, and that
the service is specified in the pupil’s IEP and individual services agreement.
11.7 CHANGE OF PUPIL RESIDENCE
11.7.A Transfer of Student Receiving Services in NON-PUBLIC School
When an individual, receiving services in a NON-PUBLIC school, moves
outside of the boundaries of the local district, the parent shall immediately
report the change of residence to the administrator of both the former and new
public school and the NON-PUBLIC school. As agreed by the terms of the
contract, the contracting NON-PUBLIC school shall immediately notify the
superintendent of the public education agencies in both the former and new
residence areas. The superintendent (or designee) of the local district making
payment to the NON-PUBLIC school must immediately notify the new local
district of the transfer and provide a copy of the student’s records, including the
IEP, and the contract for services with the NON-PUBLIC school. The fiscal
responsibility of the former local district shall terminate on the last day of the
individual’s residence in that district.
Within (15) working days of receiving the student’s records, the receiving
district in the SELPA shall conduct a review of the pupil’s IEP to determine
whether or not the NON-PUBLIC school placement is still appropriate. The
following factors shall be considered in determining the appropriateness of the
pupil’s current placement:
• No appropriate public education program is available.
• To move the individual at the time of change of residence would be
harmful to the health, welfare or educational progress of the individual.
• The NON-PUBLIC school continues to be within a reasonable distance
and/or travel time from the home of the individual.
• Other contingencies that necessitate the individual remaining at the NONPUBLIC
school as determined by the IEP team.
If the student’s NON-PUBLIC school placement is considered appropriate in
keeping with the federal mandate of the least restrictive environment, the
receiving local district shall negotiate a new contract for services with the NONPUBLIC
school. If the placement is considered inappropriate, the new local
CHAPTER 11

district shall, after a review of the IEP and with the consent of the
parent/guardian, provide the needed special education services and facilities.
11.7.B Transfer of Student in a Residential Non-Public School
When a student was placed and residing in a residential NPS prior to
transferring to a school district in another special education local plan area, and
this placement is not eligible for funding pursuant to Section 56836.16, the
special education local plan area that contains the district that made the
residential NPS placement shall continue to be responsible for the funding of
the placement, including related services, for the remainder of the school year.
An extended year session is included in the school year in which the session
ends.
(EC 56324(c))
11.8 OUT- OF- HOME PLACEMENTS
The district that places the student in an out-of-home placement through the IEP process
has the responsibility for payment for the NON-PUBLIC school costs as well as the
Board and Care costs.
If NON-PUBLIC school placement is considered necessary, the
educational costs for the non-public school are the responsibility of
the LEA.
11.8.A Out-of-Home Placements by Courts, Social Services, Regional
Center and Other Public Agencies.
1. Residential Costs
Placements made by courts, social services and regional centers are not
made by LEAs and are not necessary for the student to receive a free
appropriate public education. In most of these cases, the child’s district of
residence (i.e. the district in which their parents or legal guardians reside) is
not financially responsibility for the costs associated with the residential
placement.
In those cases where an educational agency did not make the placement
decision, the court, regional center for the developmentally disabled, or
public agency (other than an educational agency ) placing the individual in
the institution or home will be responsible for the residential and other
non-educational costs. (EC 56159, EC 56155)
CHAPTER 11

2. Educational Costs for NON-PUBLIC School Placement
Licensed Children’s Institutions (LCIs): If the IEP Team determines that

17. LCI CONTRACTOR
If CONTRACTOR is also a licensed childcare institution (LCI), Contractor shall be licensed by the state, or
other public agency having delegated authority by contract with the state to license, to provide nonmedical
care to children, including, but not limited to, individuals with exceptional needs. The LCI must also comply
with all licensing requirements relevant to the protection of the child, and have a special permit, if necessary,
to meet the needs of each child so placed. If the Contractor operates a program outside of the state, Contractor
must obtain all required licenses from the appropriate licensing agency in both California and in the state
where the LCI is located. CONTRACTOR shall adhere to the legal requirement regarding educational
placements for LCI pupils as stated in Education Code Section 56366.9. A LCI shall not require that a pupil
be placed in its NPS, or receive NPA services from the LCI provider as a condition of being placed in its
residential facility. In providing appropriate programs to individuals with exceptional needs residing in LCIs
or foster family homes, the LEA shall first consider services in programs operated by public agencies. If
those programs are not appropriate, special education and related services shall be provided by contract with
an NPS.
The LEA which placed a student living in an LCI or foster family home in an NPS shall conduct an annual
evaluation, as part of IEP process, to determine whether the placement is in the least restrictive environment
(LRE). The CONTRACTOR shall report to the LEA that made the placement, on a quarterly or trimester
basis, as appropriate, the educational progress demonstrated by the pupil toward the attainment of goals and
objectives specified in the IEP.
The LEA is not responsible for the costs associated with NPS placements and related services until the date
on which an IEP/IFSP meeting is convened pursuant to law during which the IEP/IFSP team determines that
a NPS placement and related services are appropriate, and the IEP/IFSP is signed by all necessary parties,
including the LEA pupil’s parent or another adult with educational decision-making rights.
Any educational funds received from an LEA for the educational costs of pupils placed in an NPS shall be
used solely for those purposes and not for the costs of the residential programs.
18. CERTIFICATION AND WAIVER
When a CONTRACTOR seeks renewal of certification, the CONTRACTOR shall provide the LEA, in which
the applicant is located, written notification of its intent to seek renewal.
CONTRACTOR shall be certified by the California Department of Education (hereinafter referred
to as “CDE”) as a nonpublic, nonsectarian school/agency. All nonpublic school and nonpublic
agency services shall be provided consistent with the area of certification specified by CDE
Certification and as defined in California Education Code, section 56366 et seq and within the
professional scope of practice of each provider’s license, certification and/or credential. A current
copy of CONTRACTOR’s nonpublic school/agency certification or a waiver of such certification
issued by the CDE pursuant to Education Code section 56366.2 must be provided to LEA on or
before the date this contract is executed by CONTRACTOR. This Master Contract shall be null and
void if such certification or waiver is expired, revoked, rescinded, or otherwise nullified during the
effective period of this Master Contract. Total student enrollment shall be limited to capacity as
stated on CDE certification.
In addition to meeting the certification requirements of the State of California, Contractor that
operates a program outside of this state shall be certified or licensed by that state to provide,
respectively, special education and related services to pupils under the federal Individuals with
Disabilities Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq.).

CHAPTER 13
-1 -
LOW INCIDENCE PURCHASING
The SELPA Office shall provide guidelines for the purchase of specialized books, materials and
equipment for students meeting the criteria for low incidence funding of specialized services as
set forth by the California Department of Education Special Education Division.
13.1 OVERVIEW
Funding for the purchase of specialized books, materials and equipment for students
meeting the criteria for low incidence funding of specialized services is provided by the
State of California. Students must fall within the following categories: hard of hearing,
deafness, visual impairment, severe orthopedic impairment, and deaf-blindness. Those
students, who meet the criteria for low incidence funding of specialized services, are
determined by the assessment of a student with a suspected low incidence disability. This
assessment is conducted by persons knowledgeable of that disability and an
individualized education program (IEP) prepared for each pupil with low incidence
disabilities as defined in Section 56026.5 of the Education Code. See Appendix E for the
Funding for Specialized Books, Material and Equipment for Low Incidence Students – Summary
of Legal Requirements
Once it is determined by the IEP Team that a student requires the purchase of specialized
books, materials and equipment, and meets the criteria for low incidence funding of
specialized services, a Low Incidence Requisition Form is prepared and a copy of the
supporting IEP forms:
1. MIS Summary Page or Forms 1 & 2A with LI disability designated as primary
or secondary
2. Form 3A/B with a goal incorporating LI equipment being requested.
CHAPTER 13
-2 -
ONLY SEND the MIS Summary Page/IEP FORMS 1 & 2A, with IEP Form 3A/B. If
an amendment (Form 10) is completed with the goal and not included in Form 3A/B,
include Form 10.
The Low Incidence Requisition Form and the MIS Summary Page/IEP Forms 1 & 2A, with
Form 3A or 3B are sent to the respective district Director of Special Education for approval.
After district approval, the low incidence requisition is forwarded to the SELPA Director
for further processing, preparation of a purchase order, obtaining additional approvals as
necessary, placing the order, etc.
NOTE: The Low Incidence Requisition Form is now available electronically.
As a condition of receiving these funds, the responsible SELPAs, or local education
agencies, shall ensure that the appropriate books, materials and equipment are purchased.
The use of the equipment will be coordinated as necessary, and the books, materials and
equipment will be reassigned to other qualifying SELPAs and local education agencies,
within the special education local plan area, once the SELPA or agency, who originally
received the books, materials and equipment, no longer requires them.
When a student is on an inter-district transfer and is in need of low incidence, equipment,
material or services, the district of residence will pay for the equipment out its Low
Incidence Funds.
Home Use of Low Incidence Equipment
In some cases Low Incidence Equipment may need to be used in the home for the student
to receive FAPE. If equipment will be used in the home it is important to complete the
Home Use of Low Incidence Equipment form.
Property Change Notice/Surplus Equipment
If LI equipment is being transferred to another student or another site complete the
Property Change Notice/Surplus Equipment form. This form is also used if this equipment is
going to be classified as surplus.
When Student Moves to another District
EC 56836.22 (e) states that “it is intent of the legislature that SELPAs share unused
equipment, books and materials with neighboring SELPAs… “If the book, materials and
equipment are still needed by other students with low incidence disabilities in the SELPA
there is no requirement to send it with the student who moved away. Providing these
resources is the responsibility of the SELPA where the student now resides. If however
books, materials and equipment purchased with low incidence funds are unused, SELPAs
are encouraged to make arrangements with other SELPAs to share the unused equipment,
books and materials. Special rules apply if the LI equipment is an assistive technology
device(s), as referenced below.
CHAPTER 13
-3 -
When a Student Graduates
Pursuant to E.C 56822, books, materials and equipment purchased with low incidence
funds remain the property of the State. Since the student has graduated from high school,
he/she is no longer eligible to receive special education and related services. Therefore,
districts CANNOT give the books, materials and equipment to the student. This would
be a gift of public funds. Districts cannot sell the equipment to parents/students.
Low Incidence Equipment that is also Assistive Technology.
Pursuant to E.C. 56040.3, low incidence equipment that is considered assistive technology
may need to be provided to a student outside of school environments and after a student
disenrolls from a local educational agency (LEA) and enrolls in a new LEA, including a
Charter School. Specifically, low incidence equipment that is also an assistive technology
device must be provided outside of school when a student’s IEP team determines a
student needs access to that device(s) in the student’s home or other settings in order to
receive a free, appropriate public education. Moreover, when a student with such assistive
technology LI equipment enrolls in another Local Educational Agency (LEA), including a
Charter School, the original LEA is responsible for providing continued access to the
device until (1) alternative arrangements for providing the student the device, or
comparable device, can be made, or (2) two months from the time the student disenrolled
from the original LEA; whichever occurs first.

CHAPTER 13
APPENDIX A
Use of Low Incidence Service Funds
The use of these funds is limited to expenditures supporting low incidence specialized services, such as “qualified
interpreters, note takers, readers, transcribers, and others who provide specialized services to students with low incidence
disabilities pursuant to EC §56026.5.” These specialized services must relate to unique educational needs resulting from
the pupil’s low incidence disability or disabilities. Low incidence funds are to be used to supplement, and not to supplant
existing services (i.e. to provide additional services beyond those funded through the base program or another agency).
All approvals are subject to audit by the State; therefore, all guidelines must be met prior to reimbursement. Amount of
reimbursement will depend upon the district’s Low Incidence funds balance.
Funding for Specialized Services
Criteria:
1. Each student for whom a service is reimbursed has a “low incidence” disability.
2. The service is “specialized” (relates to a need/s) resulting from the low incidence disability, as indicated in the
comprehensive assessment in all areas related to the student’s disability, involving staff who is credentialed/
knowledgeable in the low incidence disability area.
3. The service is “required for the student with a disability to benefit from special education”.
4. Low incidence funds are used to “supplement”, not to “supplant” existing services. (i.e., funds are to be used for
additional services beyond those proved through special education funds, the base program or by another agency).
The service is considered a “support service.”
5. Expenditures for low incidence specialized services are limited to direct services (i.e. interpreters, note-takers,
readers, transcribers) to the pupils with low incidence disabilities, and cannot be used for services to staff, or for any
other purpose. These funds should not be used to provide services to meet general education needs provided
through the base program.
6. Personnel providing services to meet the specialized health care needs related to a student's low incidence disability
must meet the requirements of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 5, §3051.12(b).
SCHOOL SITE SUBMISSION CHECKLIST!
Requests for specialized service reimbursement can be made by submitting the Low Incidence Service
Reimbursement Form and can only be approved if all the following criteria are met:
1. The Low Incidence Reimbursement Request Form is fully filled out.
2.
Service is directly related to the student’s unique educational need resulting from the low
incidence disability.
3. Low Incidence Service Reimbursement Request Form is signed by your Special Education
Director.
4. Includes a copy of current MIS Summary and/or IEP Form 1 & 2A or IFSP document that
indicates a low incidence disability for student. No “Drafts”!
5. Includes a copy of IEP Form 3A/B or IFSP document that clearly shows a goal/objective which
directly relates to the use of the specialized service for which the reimbursement is requested.

CHAPTER 13
APPENDIX C
California Department of Education Special Education Division
FUNDING FOR SPECIALIZED BOOKS, MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, and SERVICES FOR
LOW INCIDENCE STUDENTS
Education Code (EC) Section (§) 56836.22 provides for funds to purchase specialized books,
materials, and equipment as required under the individualized education program (IEP) for each
pupil with low incidence disabilities as defined in §56026.5 ("hearing impairments, vision
impairments, severe orthopedic impairments, or any combination thereof").
Funding is determined by dividing the total number of pupils in California with low incidence
disabilities, as reported in the December 1st prior year unduplicated pupil count, in the following
categories: hard of hearing, deaf, visually impaired, orthopedically impaired, and deaf-blind into the
annual appropriation provided for this purpose in the Budget Act. The Budget Act allows this funding
to be used only “for purchase, repair and inventory maintenance" for equipment, materials and
specialized books, and specialized services used by students with low incidence disabilities.
As a condition of receiving these funds, "the responsible local agency shall ensure that the
appropriate books, materials, and equipment are purchased, the use of the equipment is
coordinated as necessary, and that the books, materials, and equipment are reassigned to local
education agencies (LEA) within the special education local plan area (SELPA) once the agency
that originally received the books, materials, and equipment no longer needs them."
It is also the "intent of the Legislature that local plan areas share unused low incidence books,
materials, and equipment with neighboring SELPAs.” If the equipment, materials or specialized
books are no longer needed within the SELPA or a neighboring SELPA, the Department of
Education Low Incidence Program Consultant shall be contacted to reassign the resources
elsewhere within California. Items purchased with these funds may only be used by students with
low incidence disabilities, unless a waiver has been approved by the State Board of Education.
EC §56320(g) requires that:
"The assessment of a pupil, including the assessment of a pupil with a suspected low incidence
disability, shall be conducted by persons knowledgeable of that disability. Special attention shall
be given to the unique educational needs, including, but not limited to, skills and the need for
specialized services, materials, and equipment consistent with guidelines established pursuant
to §56136."
EC §56327(h) states, "The personnel who assess the pupil shall prepare a written report, as
appropriate, of the results of each assessment. The report shall include, but not be limited to, all of
the following:
"The need for specialized services, materials, and equipment for pupils with low incidence
disabilities consistent with guidelines established pursuant to §56136."
EC §56345(b)(5) states, "When appropriate, the individualized educational program shall also
include…
For pupils with low incidence disabilities, specialized services, materials, and equipment,
consistent with guidelines established pursuant to §56136."
EC §56136 requires that:
The Superintendent of Public Instruction to "develop guidelines for each low incidence
disability area and provide technical assistance to parents, teachers, and administrators
regarding the implementation of the guidelines."
CHAPTER 13
APPENDIX D
California Department of Education Special Education Division
EC §56206 states, "As a part of the local plan submitted pursuant to §56200, each SELPA shall
describe how specialized equipment and services will be distributed within the local plan area in a
manner that minimizes the necessity to serve pupils in isolated sites and maximizes the
opportunities to serve pupils in the least restrictive environment."
EC §56363(b)(16) states the Related Services "may include but not be limited to:
Specialized services for low incidence disabilities, such as readers, transcribers, and vision and
hearing services."
These services are further defined in California Code of Regulations, Title 5, §3051.16:
"Specialized Services for low incidence disabilities may include:
(b) Specialized services related to the unique needs of pupils with low incidence disabilities
provided by qualified individuals such as interpreters, note takers, readers, transcribers, and
other individuals who provide specialized materials and equipment."
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that the IEP team shall "consider
whether the child requires assistive technology devices and services" for all students with
disabilities. IEP requirements also include the need, as appropriate, for "…Braille" instruction for
students who are "blind or visually impaired", and "language and communication needs…" "for
students who are "deaf or hard of hearing. The Special Education Division's Web site contains a
memorandum regarding assistive technology, and details on these, and other changes in federal
and state requirements resulting from reauthorization of IDEA, 2004 and other legislation.
Since the use of these funds is limited to expenditures on books, materials, equipment, and services
for students with low incidence disabilities, the purchase must relate to the unique educational
needs resulting from the low incidence disability as indicated in the IEP of eligible students. For
example, regular textbooks and workbooks would not qualify in contrast to low vision aids, digital
media, large print or Braille books for students who are visually impaired. Bolsters and mats for
young children should be a part of basic equipment and would not qualify, while specialized adapted
feeding and self-care equipment, needed by children because of their severe orthopedic
impairments, would qualify. It is therefore important that specialized teachers who are credentialed
to serve students with specific low incidence disabilities be involved in the team assessment
process and attend the IEP meetings so that books, materials, equipment, and services considered
for purchase for low incidence students are related directly to the unique educational needs resulting
from a low incidence disability.
Students with low incidence disabilities enrolled in non-public and private schools by the public
school, or served in the student's home when required under the IEP, pursuant to SELPA local plan
policies and procedures are also eligible to have books, materials, and equipment purchased for
their use by low incidence funds. Reasonable care must be taken, however, to prevent damage, loss
or theft.
Purchasing specialized equipment and materials and specialized services for infants with low
incidence disabilities is also an allowable expenditure for Part C funds. The purchase must relate to
a need documented in the IEP based on assessment results for each pupil receiving the services.
Expenditures for low incidence specialized services are limited to direct services (i.e. interpreters,
note-takers, readers, transcribers) to the pupils with low incidence disabilities, and cannot be used
for services to staff, or for any other purpose. These funds should not be used to provide services to
meet general education needs provided through the base program.
CHAPTER 13
APPENDIX D
California Department of Education Special Education Division
Personnel providing services to meet the specialized health care needs related to a student's low
incidence disability must meet the requirements of the CCR, Title 5, §3051.12(b).
It is permissible to "pool" funds to be used by one or more students with low incidence disabilities.
There is no legal limitation on the amount of funding for any particular student.
Since there may not be adequate funding to meet all the needs of all eligible students with low
incidence disabilities, responsible LEAs should establish a priority for the allocating of these funds,
using procedures outlined in the SELPAs local plan for special education.
Low Incidence funds allocated under EC 56836.22 may not be used to:
1. Support staff development. It is suggested that technical support and training be included when
equipment is purchased. SELPAs are encouraged to collaboratively develop regionalized multiagency
funded centers that can provide ongoing technical support, training and address other
activities and assure funds are used in the most cost-effective manner.
2. Purchase medical therapy units for California Children's Services. LEAs shall provide necessary
space and equipment for the provision of occupational therapy and physical therapy in the most
efficient and effective manner.
3. Purchase medical equipment needed for providing specialized health needs since California
Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 5, §3051.12(b)(3)(C), states that "the school district shall not
be required to purchase medical equipment for an individual student."
4. Construct or alter facilities (for example, building ramps), or to acquire storage units.
5. Supplant books, equipment and materials that have been provided by other agencies. Low
incidence funds are to be used only to supplement, and not to supplant other available funding
for books, materials and equipment provided through the base program for general education
and/or special education students. For example, basic computers or other basic technology
should not be purchased with low incidence funds unless it can be clearly demonstrated to fulfill
a specialized function, format or adaptation directly related to the low incidence disability.
General education or other special education funding should be used for purchasing such basic
items.
Since use of these funds is limited, "for purchase, repair and inventory maintenance" for equipment,
materials and specialized books used by students with low incidence disabilities, any "coordinating"
activity necessary to allow for the tracking of books, materials and equipment for students with low
incidence disabilities must come from funds other than those allocated under EC 56836.22.
The Low Incidence Program Consultant and the Clearinghouse for Specialized Media and
Translations (CSMT) can assist and advise SELPAs or LEA’s in reassigning surplus materials and
equipment statewide or provide information regarding the disposal of unusable surplus items. If you

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
1. May Low Incidence funding be spent in only one of the eligible low incidence disability areas
even though all Low Incidence disability students generate income?
Yes. Although the allocation is generated on a per student basis and must be expended on only
students who have a Low Incidence disability, there is no requirement that income be spent
proportionally on each of the various disability groups consistent with the funds generated. It is a
local decision of the LEA or SELPA regarding how the available low incidence funds are spent
as long as revenue for equipment, books and materials isn’t commingled with specialized
services funds.
2. Is a SELPA or LEA required to use Low Incidence Funding to purchase prescription devices?
The California State Board of Education has adopted CCR, Title 5, §3051.12(b)(3)(c), which
states in part that "the school district shall not be required to purchase medical equipment for an
individual student.” Based on this regulation, the CDE has a long standing practice to encourage
the purchase of prescription devices and medical equipment through other funding sources such
as private medical insurance or Medi-Cal.
3. If a student with a low incidence disability within our SELPA for whom we purchased books,
materials and equipment with our low incidence funds moves to a different SELPA, are we
required to send the books materials and equipment with the student to the new SELPA?
No. EC §56836.22 (e) states in part that “it is the intent of the legislature that SELPAs share
unused equipment, books and materials with neighboring SELPAs….” If the books, materials
and equipment are still needed by other students with low incidence disabilities in your
SELPA/County, there is no requirement to send it with the student who moved away. Providing
these resources is the responsibility of the SELPA where the student now resides. If, however,
books, materials and equipment purchased with low incidence funds are unused, SELPAs are
encouraged to make arrangements with other SELPAs to share the unused equipment, books
and materials. The CDE may be contacted for assistance in locating another SELPA that has
need of the unused equipment, books or materials.
4. We have students in our SELPA who have visual perception problems. Does this disability
qualify as a visual impairment for low incidence funding?
No. EC §56026.5 states "Low incidence disability" means a severe disabling condition with an
expected incidence rate of less than one percent of the total statewide enrollment in
kindergarten through grade twelve. For purposes of this definition, severe disabling conditions
are hearing impairments, vision impairments, and severe orthopedic impairments, or any
combination thereof. Vision impairments as defined by EC §56350 (c) do not include a pupil who
is eligible for special education and related services based on a specific learning disability within
the function of vision which results in visual perceptual or visual motor dysfunction identified
pursuant to §56338.
5. We have a student who is both severely emotionally disturbed and blind. Will we receive low
incidence funding for this student?
Visual Impairment is one of the severe disabling conditions defined by EC §56026.5 as a low
incidence disability. The language “or any combination thereof” has been interpreted to mean a
CHAPTER 13
APPENDIX D
California Department of Education Special Education Division
student is eligible for Low Incidence funding if (s)he has at least one of the three severe
disabling condition regardless of any other disabilities that may also be present. Therefore, a
student who has multiple disabilities will generate Low Incidence funding as long as that student
has been reported on the CASEMIS pupil count in either Disability 1 or Disability 2 as either
hearing impaired, visually impaired or severely orthopedically impaired. Since students with low
incidence disabilities may be reported in either the Disability 1 or Disability 2 category on the
CASEMIS, first there is a count of disability 1 data. Then there is a count of disability 2 to
capture those students with low incidence disabilities that were not reported in Disability 1. This
ensures that the total count is an unduplicated count.

FREE AND APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION (FAPE)
In order to ensure that a free, appropriate public education is available to all children with
disabilities in the SELPA, the LEAs of the SELPA shall provide:
 for a combination of special education and related services as determined through
each student’s individual education program (IEP) development and review;
 that the unique needs of the student are met so that the individual benefits from access
to educational opportunities, and
 that the student is prepared for employment and independent living.
FAPE means special education and related services that are provided at public expense,
under public supervision and direction, and without charge; that meet the standards of the
State of California and of federal law; that include preschool, elementary school, and
secondary education; and are provided in conformity with the IEP.
FAPE shall be reasonably calculated to confer educational benefit to the student. It shall
be the responsibility of each LEA to monitor such benefit for each student with a disability,
through both the individual review and agency-wide process reviews. Evidence may
include passing grades, advancement from grade to grade, improvement on state-wide
assessments.
To determine whether an IEP is reasonably calculated to provide educational benefit,
LEAs should ask:
1. Is the student’s IEP individualized to meet the unique needs of the student?
2. Has the student been educated in the least restrictive environment (LRE)?
3. Have the student’s educational services been provided in a collaborative and
coordinated manner?
4. Has the student demonstrated positive academic and non-academic benefits?
Each LEA in the SELPA shall ensure that a student-focused and compliant process to
develop IEPs for each child with a disability will be followed based on state and federal
law and regulations. The SELPA shall support each LEA in its implementation through
professional opportunities, technical assistance, support and monitoring.

FULL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY
In order to insure that all students with disabilities have equal access to the
variety of educational programs and services available to typically developing
peers, including non-academic and extracurricular services and activities, each
LEA shall implement non-discriminatory universal access to opportunities to all
such services and activities available to typically developing peers.
Each LEA through the IEP process shall review the special education and related
services provided to students to ensure adequate yearly progress is occurring.
Adequate yearly progress can be addressed through a variety of data collection
activities including but not limited to: state wide assessment, standards-based
goals, curriculum assessments and portfolios. Per the Rowley Decision (1982),
the Supreme Court decision indicated that federal law generates no additional
requirement that the services provided be sufficient to maximize each child’s
potential commensurate with the opportunity provided other students and that
the IEP development is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive
educational benefit.
The LEAs with the Santa Clara County SELPAs I, II, III, IV & VII will consider
the four-part inclusion test outlined in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision
in Holland v. Sacramento City Unified School District:
1. The educational benefits available to the student in a general education
classroom supplemented with appropriate aids and services, as compared
with the educational benefits of a special education classroom;
2. The non-academic benefits of interaction with typically developing peers;
3. The effect of the student’s presence on the teacher and other students in
the classroom; and
4. The cost of including the student in the general education classroom.
Each LEA that contract with nonpublic, nonsectarian schools shall evaluate the
placement of its students in each school on, at least, an annual basis as part of the
annual review. The LEA representative shall review the NPS/NPA Master
Contract, the Individual Services Agreement, and the IEP to ensure that all services
agreed upon and specified in the IEP are provided. Nonpublic, nonsectarian
schools are required by the Master Contract and the IEP to annually evaluate the
students to determine if they are making appropriate educational progress. The
LEA representative shall collaboratively review with the nonpublic, nonsectarian
school the evaluations conducted by the nonpublic, nonsectarian school to
ensure that they were appropriate and valid for measuring student progress.
The LEA may choose to administer additional assessments as necessary, with

LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT
Special education is an integral part of the total public education system and
provides education in a manner that provides maximum interaction between
students with disabilities and typically developing peers, in a manner
appropriate to the needs of both. To the maximum extent appropriate, students
with disabilities will be educated with their typically developing peers. Special
classes, separate schooling, or other removal of students with disabilities from
the general education environment occurs only when the nature or severity of
the disability of a child is such that education in general education classes with
the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be satisfactorily achieved.
The four-part inclusion test (listed below) as outlined by the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals decision in Holland v. Sacramento City Unified School District:
1. The educational benefits available to the student in a general education
classroom supplemented with appropriate aids and services, as compared
with the educational benefits of a special education classroom;
2. The non-academic benefits of interaction with typically developing peers;
3. The effect of the student’s presence on the teacher and other students in
the classroom; and
4. The cost of including the student in the general education classroom.
Training on LRE and IEP responsibilities will be provided and are outlined the
SELPA IEP Manual, Writing IEPs for Educational Benefit.
When size and scope factors prevent a LEA from directly providing a required
service for a student with a disability, the service may be provided by the County
Office of Education, or by another LEA as outlined in the SELPA Annual Service
Plan.
In determining the appropriate LRE placement for students with disabilities, the
IEP Team shall:
1. Determine if the student can be served in a general education classroom
setting at the student’s neighborhood school with supplemental aids and
services. The IEP shall specify any needed supplemental aids and
services.
CHAPTER 14

2. Determine if the student can be served by the special education services
provided at the student’s neighborhood school campus. The IEP shall
specify the extent to which the student will not be in the general education
classroom setting and activities.
If the IEP Team determines the special education and related services at the
student’s neighborhood school campus are not appropriate to meet the needs as
outlined by the IEP Team, the following shall be implemented:
1. Document why a different school site is necessary, including why
education at the neighborhood school site with supplemental aids and
services is not appropriate to meet the needs of the students.
2. For students being transitioned to the neighborhood school setting for all
or part of the school day, specify the timeline for transition as well as the
activities needed to support the transition.
The SELPA has a SCCOE Special Education Housing Policy and Licensed Children’s
Institutions and Foster Family Homes that address the importance of students’ receiving
special education and related services in the least restrictive environment. The
Housing Policy describes the process used to place special education programs to
locations on general education campuses and for appropriate distribution
throughout the county.
The LEAs will continue to locate facilities and programs designed to serve students
with severe disabilities on general education campuses to the extent that the needs of
students, as determined by the IEP Team, can best be met within an instructional
setting of a general education campus.
The IEP form contains a statement of:
 Supplemental aids and services that the student needs to ensure participation
in general education.
 A statement that students will participate in a general education environment
with typically developing peers unless the student’s full time involvement
and progress in general education is precluded by the nature and severity of
the disability.
No student will be referred for special education unless the general education
resources have been considered, utilized, and the documented accommodations
and/or modifications have been made prior to referral for special education services.

CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ENROLLED IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS
BY THEIR PARENTS
Policy
The Child Find process in Santa Clara County SELPAs shall be designed to ensure equitable participation
of parentally placed private school children with disabilities and an accurate count of such children. It is
also the policy of Santa Clara County SELPAs for Districts of the parent or guardian's Residence
(“DOR") to stand ready to offer a free appropriate education (“FAPE”) to identified students ages 3
to 21 if and when a parent/guardian requests development of an IEP. Compliance with this policy and
its procedures is intended to ensure evidence of compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations
concerning children so identified.
Procedures
(For the purposes of this policy, “LEA” means district where the private school is located and “DOR” where
the parent of the child resides.)
A. Consultation
LEA shall consult with private school representatives and representatives of parents during the design
and development of special education and related services for parentally placed children in private
schools, including regarding:
1. The child find process and how children suspected of having a disability can participate
equitably, including how parents, teachers, and private school officials will be informed of the
process.
2. The determination of the proportionate amount of Federal funds available to serve parentally
placed private school children with disabilities including how the amount was calculated.
3. The consultation process will:
a) define how the process will operate throughout the year.
b) ensure that parentally placed private school children with disabilities can meaningfully
participate in special education.
4. The LEA will consult regarding how, where, and by whom special education and related services
will be provided including a discussion of:
a) direct services and alternate service delivery mechanisms.
b) how services will be apportioned if funds are insufficient to serve all children.
c) how and when these decisions will be made.
d) how the LEA will provide the private school officials a written explanation of the reasons
why the LEA chose not to provide services directly or through a contractor if the LEA
disagrees with the views of the private school officials regarding the provision or types of
services.
CHAPTER 14
14.14
B. Child Find Requirements
The LEA will conduct Child Find activities that will be:
1. conducted in a time period comparable to Child Find for public school children.
2. designed to ensure “equitable participation” of parentally placed children in private school and an
accurate count.
3. designed to include activities similar to those activities undertaken for public school children.
**Costs for Child Find activities are not part of the proportionate share of federal funding.
C. Calculation of Proportionate Share of Federal Funding
In calculating the proportionate share of federal funding, the LEA will:
1. consult in a timely and meaningful manner with representatives of private schools.
2. conduct a thorough and complete child find process to determine the number of parentally placed
children with disabilities attending private schools located in the LEA.
3. Maintain, (and provide to CDE), records of the number of children evaluated, found eligible, and
served.
D. Written Affirmation Form Signed by Private School Representatives
1. The LEA will obtain written affirmation signed by the representatives of the participating private
schools.
2. If the private school officials do not provide such affirmation within a reasonable period of time,
the LEA will forward the documentation to the CDE.
E. Private School Officials Right to Complain
A private school official will have the right to complain to the CDE that:
1. the LEA did not engage in consultation that was meaningful and timely, or
2. the LEA did not give due consideration to the view of the private school official.
If a complaint is filed:
1. The private school official will provide the CDE with a basis for the complaint.
2. The LEA must then forward the appropriate documentation to the CDE.
3. If dissatisfied with the decision of the CDE, the private school official may appeal to the USDOE.
F. Initial Individualized Education Program (IEP) Team Meeting
1. In cases in which the LEA locates/identifies a child suspected of being a child with a disability,
upon identifying and locating such a child, the LEA shall conduct an initial assessment of the child
as well as any SST meetings preceding assessment. Consistent with 34 CFR 300.622(b) (3), the
LEA shall request of the parent written consent to an exchange of information between the LEA
and the DOR (in cases where the LEA where the private school is located is not the DOR) The
LEA and the DOR will further collaborate in regard to the initial meeting to address eligibility of
the child for special education, and the development of an IEP and a services plan, as appropriate.
This collaboration is intended to ensure that assessments and meetings take place in a timely
CHAPTER 14
14.14
fashion, the LEA has the opportunity to offer a services plan, as appropriate, and that the DOR has
the opportunity to develop an offer of FAPE as appropriate. Thus, the two agencies may decide
to hold one meeting where representatives of both agencies are present to ensure compliance by
each agency.
2. In cases where the DOR is located outside Santa Clara County, the LEA continues to be responsible
for initial assessment. The LEA shall contact the DOR after receipt of written parental consent and
invite the DOR to the eligibility IEP meeting. If the parent states that he/she intends to enroll in
public school, the LEA will contact the DOR to convene an IEP meeting in order to develop the
full offer of FAPE.
3. In cases in which a referral for assessment is made directly to the DOR (as opposed to the LEA),
the DOR has the obligation to assess the child, assuming that assessment is appropriate/necessary.
This duty to assess is in addition to/concurrent with any duty to assess on the part of the LEA.
4. If the parents of a private school child with a disability are clearly not interested in enrolling their
child in public school, the LEA shall develop a services plan in accordance with this policy and
federal and state laws and regulations. The DOR may elect not to develop an IEP and offer FAPE.
However, in order to ensure that the parents' intentions are clear, the DOR shall request that the
parents sign the following statement on the SELPA Form entitled “Certification of Parent's
Decision Not to Enroll in Public School."
Parents of _____________ hereby certify that we are not interested in enrolling
our child, _____________, in the district. We are not interested in the
development of an IEP for our child, the district's offer of a free appropriate public
education, and are only interested in a services plan from the LEA, the school
district where the private school in which we are unilaterally placing our child is
located. We have received the Santa Clara County SELPA Notice of Parents'
Rights, and we understand the notice.
5. The DOR will develop an IEP and offer FAPE if the parent demonstrates the intent in writing to
enroll the child in public school or if the parent is or appears uncertain of his/her course of action.
6. Pursuant to this policy, assistive technology or augmentative communication devices will not be
transferred to private schools or purchased for students enrolled in private schools.
7. The LEA shall not provide transportation from the child’s home to the private school. The LEA
may provide transportation from the child’s school or home to the service site other than the private
school and/or from the service site to the private school or the child’s home. The cost of
transportation shall be included in calculating whether the LEA has spent a proportionate amount
of funding on private school children with disabilities.
G. IEP Meetings after the Initial IEP Team Meeting
1. All children with disabilities eligible for special education who reside in the DOR are entitled to
receive an offer of FAPE from the DOR if the child's parents forward a request to the DOR, in
writing, requesting development of an IEP. The DOR has no obligation to develop an IEP for a
private school child absent such a request.
2. The LEA will review the Services Plan annually and conduct a triennial assessment for students on
Services Plans. The LEA will consult with the DOR prior to the triennial evaluation.
3. Unless paragraph G (4) below applies, the parents shall be requested to send the document referred
to in G (1) back to the DOR and indicate their agreement with one of the following statements:
CHAPTER 14
14.14
a) I understand that the DOR continues to offer my child a free appropriate public education
(including appropriate special education and related services) if he/she is enrolled in public
school. I continue to unilaterally place my child in a private school; and:
I would like my child to continue to receive services pursuant to his/her services plan. I am not
interested in enrolling my child in public school. (In this case, the DOR will forward within 3
business days a copy of this document to the LEA)
OR
b) I am interested in enrolling my child in public school. I would like to schedule an IEP team
meeting for my child. Please call me at: [parent inserts phone number] in order to schedule the
IEP meeting.
4. Notwithstanding paragraphs G (1) and (2) above, the DOR shall convene an IEP team meeting at
least every three years in order to determine continuing eligibility for special education.
H. Dispute Resolution
1. Pursuant to federal regulations, parents are not entitled to a due process hearing involving disputes
over the contents of the services plans, their quality, or their implementation. A parent's right to
seek a due process hearing is limited to the issue of the LEA’s failure to identify, locate, and assess
a privately placed student.
2. Disputes regarding this policy and procedures may be resolved pursuant to local uniform complaint
policies and procedures, and/or by filing a complaint with the California Department of Education
pursuant to Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations Section 4600 et seq.
3. No parentally placed private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some
or all of the special education and related services that he/she would receive if enrolled in a public
school.

MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT (MOE) POLICY
SELPAs I, II, III, IV, & VII shall comply with the federal Maintenance of Effort (MOE)
requirement that federal IDEA funds shall only be used to supplement and not to
supplant state and local funding for special education services. Reference: Title 34 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Sections 300.231-300.233
Compliance shall be determined and reported twice a year: In October, comparing
Budget for Special Education with Actual Expenditures from the previous year, and in
December, comparing Actual Expenditures from the previous year with Actual
Expenditures the year prior to that. SELPAs and LEAs must pass at least one of the
following tests in the October Budget to Actuals determination and at least one of the
tests in the December Actual to Actual determination, in order to receive and keep
Federal IDEA Part B Funding:
October – Budget to Actual determination:
Section 1: Exempt reduction under 34 CFR Section 300.204 - SELPA or LEA is
allowed to reduce Budgeted Expenditures from state and/or local resources by the
following exceptions:
1. The voluntary departure or departure for just cause, of special education or
related service personnel, who are replaced by qualified, lower salaried staff.
2. A decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities.
3. The termination of the obligation of the agency to provide a program of
special education to a particular child with disabilities that is an
exceptionally costly program because the child:
a. has left the jurisdiction of the agency
b. has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide
FAPE to the child has terminated: or
c. no longer needs the program of special education
4. The termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the
acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.
5. The assumption of cost by the high cost fund operated by the SELPA under 34
CFR Section 300.704(c)
CHAPTER 14
14.15
Revised January 2012
Section 2: SELPA or LEA is allowed to reduce budgeted state and /or local
expenditures by 50% of the increase in Federal IDEA Part B funds from prior year
to current year. If the LEA exercises this authority, the LEA shall use an amount
of local funds equal to the reduction in expenditures to carry out activities
authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. (HR 1350
Sec. 613(2) (C) (i) & (ii). Also the allowable amount of Part B Funds used for early
intervening services (up to 15%) will count toward the 50%. IMPORTANT: Only
LEAs that have a “meets requirement” compliance determination and that are not
found significantly Disproportionate for both the current year and principle year
are eligible to use this option to reduce their MOE requirement. IDEA Section
613(a)(2)(c) 34 CFR Section 300.205
Section 3: Budgeted Expenditures for Special Education from State and/or Local
Funds is greater than Actual Expenditures for Special Education from State
and/or Local Funds the previous year, either in total, or per pupil.
Budget to Actual Report
Using the CDE state software Special Education Maintenance of Effort (Budget) SEMB
1. LEAs submit LEA reports to SELPA AU office by September deadline each year.
2. SELPA AU will compile the LEA reports into a SELPA level report and submit that
report to the CDE by the October deadline.
A. If the SELPA passes the SEMB test, Federal IDEA Part B funds will flow to the
SELPA in the current year. The SELPA AU will determine individual LEA
eligibility to receive Federal IDEA funds.
(1) If all LEAs within the SELPA meet the MOE requirements, all LEAs
will receive Federal IDEA Part B funds in the current year,
allocated based on prior year December Pupil Count.
(2) If a LEA fails Budget to Actual Comparison and has not rectified
the problem by the last day in February, its proportionate share of
the federal funds shall be re-distributed within the SELPA in a
manner that would not create a failure of MOE on the part of any
LEA receiving such funds. An Executive Council Meeting will be
convened to determine the redistribution of the IDEA Part B funds.
B. If the SELPA fails to pass the SEMB software test, no Federal IDEA funds will flow
to the SELPA in the current year.
CHAPTER 14

Using the CDE state software Special Education Maintenance of Effort (Actuals) SEMA
1. LEAs report to SELPA AU office by November deadline of each year.
2. SELPA AU will compile LEA reports into a SELPA level report and submit that report
to the CDE by the December deadline.
A. If the SELPA passes the SEMA test, Federal IDEA Part B funds received the
previous year will not need to be returned to the state. The SELPA AU will
determine LEA eligibility to keep Federal Part B IDEA funds received in the
previous year.
(1) If all LEAs within the SELPA meet the MOE requirements at the LEA level,
all LEAs will keep Federal IDEA Part B funds received in the previous year.
(2) If the SELPA as whole passes the Actual to Actual Comparison but one or
more of the individual LEAs fail to spend from state and/or local funds to
maintain their effort, the SELPA will recapture the amount that the LEA
failed to spend from state and/or local funds to maintain the required level
of effort. The amount recaptured will be distributed to the LEAs, which
passed the Actuals to Actuals Comparison in such a manner that it would
not create a failure to maintain effort on the part of any LEA receiving such
funds. An Executive Council Meeting will be convened to determine the
redistribution of the recaptured IDEA Part B funds.
B. If the SELPA fails to pass the Actuals to Actuals Comparison the amount that
the SELPA is short of meeting the requirement, will be recaptured by the CDE.
Those LEAs which failed to meet the MOE requirements in the Actuals to
Actuals test will be responsible for the loss. The amount recovered by the CDE
will be deducted from the revenue received by those LEAs.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY SELPAS I, II, III, IV, & VII
CHARTER SCHOOLS POLICY
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy applies to Charter Schools that are chartered by educational entities that are
members of the Santa Clara County SELPAs I, II, III, IV & VII and to any charter school that seeks
to become a member of one of the Santa Clara County SELPAs as a LEA, regardless of the chartering
entity. This policy also applies to any Charter School petition granted by the State Board of
Education (SBE) in which oversight responsibilities have been assigned to a member entity;
however, this policy shall not apply to any Charter School which was converted from a public
school to a Charter School, or that was initiated by a School District or a charter that is accepted as
a Local Education Agency (LEA) in another SELPA outside of Santa Clara County. This same policy
has been adopted by the Southeast Consortium for Special Education in Santa Clara County, thus
offering continuity across the county.
Students enrolled in Charter Schools are entitled to special education services provided in a manner
similar to students enrolled in other public schools. Charter Schools must comply with all
requirements of State and Federal law regarding the provision of special education services (EC
56000 et seq. and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. Chapter 33).
Children with disabilities enrolled in Charter Schools, and their parents, shall retain all rights under
the IDEA.
INTRODUCTION
Special education and related services shall be provided to all eligible individuals within the
jurisdiction of Santa Clara County SELPAs I, II, III, IV & VII in accordance with each SELPA’s Local
Plan. Students enrolled in Charter Schools, operating within SELPAs I, II, III, IV & VII shall
receive special educational and related services in a manner similar to other students. No
governing board shall grant a charter unless the charter includes assurances that special education
instruction and/or services shall be provided to all eligible students with disabilities enrolled in the
Charter School in accordance with the SELPA Local Plan. A LEA reviewing the petition for the
establishment or renewal of a Charter School may not refuse to grant the petition because
the charter school might enroll students with disabilities who reside in a SELPA other than the
one in which the LEA is a member.
Funding for special education services, participation in the governance structure and responsibility
for provision of services shall be based on the categorization of the individual Charter School as
either operating as a public school of its chartering entity or functioning as a LEA. Schools
chartered by a LEA shall negotiate their charter and MOU with the school district from which they
are seeking the charter. Charter schools may also elect to be deemed a Local Education Agency
(LEA) by providing verifiable written assurances that the Charter School will participate as a LEA
in a SELPA for purposes of the provision of special education services.
2
CHAPTER 14
14.17
Charter Schools that are deemed LEAs for special education purposes will only be admitted as a
member of a SELPA if the Charter School has provided all assurances required by this policy
and law and the admission is approved by a majority vote of the Executive Council of
Superintendents of that SELPA. In compliance with State law the respective SELPA will treat
the review and approval of a Charter School’s request to be a LEA in the same manner as a request
from another school district to join the SELPA.
SELPA INVOLVEMENT
Prior to the approval of a new charter or renewal of an existing charter or MOU, the Superintendent
or designee of the chartering entity shall consult with the SELPA Director regarding the provision
of special education services to students enrolled by the Charter School. The petitioner must
provide adequate assurances that all eligible students enrolled in the Charter School will
receive appropriate special education services in accordance with the Local Plan and law. The
charter must provide assurances that no student will be denied enrollment in the Charter School
due to a disability. The SELPA will be available to provide consultation on the potential fiscal
impact and benefit that may be associated with granting the requested charter.
An approved charter must delineate the entity responsible for providing special education
instruction and services, any anticipated transfer of special education funds between the
granting entity and the Charter School and any provisions for sharing deficits in funding.
These provisions may be included in a Memorandum of Understanding.
CATEGORIES OF CHARTER SCHOOLS
For the purposes of provision of special education services, Charter Schools may be deemed either
a public school within the chartering district/county office or a Local Education Agency (LEA). A
Charter School shall be deemed a public school within a chartering district/county office unless
the Charter School provides written verifiable assurances that the Charter School will participate
as a LEA in a SELPA approved by the State Board of Education (Note – EC
47642 clarifies that the Charter School will only receive special education funding through the
SELPA Budget Allocation Plan.)
PUBLIC SCHOOL WITHIN A DISTRICT
Charter Schools that are deemed to be public schools within a district will participate in the
State and Federal funding in the same manner as other schools within the chartering district.
The chartering district will be responsible for ensuring that all children with disabilities enrolled in
the Charter School receive special education and related services in a manner that is consistent
with their individualized education programs and all applicable provisions of State and Federal
law. The District will determine the policies and procedures necessary to ensure that the
protections of special education law extend to students in the Charter School.
The chartering district will receive and appropriately distribute all applicable special education
funds, as outlined in the SELPA Budget Allocation Plan. The chartering district will represent
the needs of students with disabilities attending Charter Schools in the same manner as it does for
its other schools. The chartering district will be responsible for ensuring that all eligible students
3
CHAPTER 14
14.17
are appropriately served. The chartering district and/or Charter School may contract for special
education services with other public or private educational entities. When a student lives outside
the boundaries of the chartering district, the district in which the child lives will have no
responsibility to provide services or pay excess costs.
The chartering district and Charter School may enter into agreements/MOUs whereby the Charter
School is billed for excess costs associated with providing special education services to identified
students, including the administration of special education programs. The Charter School may
also be held fiscally responsible through agreements/MOUs for a fair share of any encroachment
on the chartering district’s general fund that is created by the provision of special education services
throughout the district.
PUBLIC SCHOOL WITHIN THE COUNTY OFFICE
Charter Schools that are deemed to be public schools within the Santa Clara County Office of
Education (SCCOE) will participate in the State and Federal special education funding in the
following manner: (1) the SELPA where the charter school is located will distribute special
education funding to the SCCOE pursuant to the SELPA Budget Allocation Plan; (2) the SCCOE
will use these funds to fund the actual cost of special education services provided by the
Charter School up to the total amount generated; (3) any unused funds will be returned to the
SELPAs in the same proportion in which they were received. The SCCOE will be responsible for
ensuring that all children with disabilities enrolled in the Charter School receive special education
and related services in a manner that is consistent with all applicable provisions of State and Federal
law. The SCCOE will determine the policies and procedures necessary to ensure that the
protections of special education law extend to students in the Charter School.
The SCCOE will receive and appropriately distribute all applicable special education funds, as
outlined above. The SCCOE will represent the needs of students with disabilities attending Charter
Schools in the same manner as it does for its other programs. The SCCOE will be responsible for
ensuring that all eligible students are appropriately served. The SCCOE and/or the Charter School
may contract for these services with public or private educational entities. When a student lives
outside the boundaries of the SCCOE, the district in which the child lives will have no responsibility
to provide services or pay excess costs.
The SCCOE and the Charter School may enter into agreements/MOUs whereby the Charter School
is billed for excess costs, based on the SELPA-wide average rate of local support per ADA,
associated with the provision of special education services to identified students, including
the administration of special education programs.
CHARTER SCHOOL AS AN LEA WITHIN THE SELPA
A Charter School may apply to become a LEA for the provision of special education services.
Application must be made to the respective SELPA by February first of the school year
preceding the school year in which the Charter School anticipates operating as a LEA within the
SELPA. The Executive Council of Superintendents will determine whether the Charter School
has provided the requisite assurances.
4
CHAPTER 14
14.17
The Charter School seeking to become a LEA must provide written, verifiable assurances of its
capacity to, among other things:
 Meet the terms of the Local Plan and State and Federal Law regarding: identification, referral
evaluation, placement and the provision of a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) in the
least restrictive environment (LRE) to special education students.
 Provide adequate staffing to meet Federal and State mandates.
 Agree that the Charter School will use SELPA approved forms and provide requested data in
a timely manner.
 Meet the terms of the Local Plan regarding Procedural Safeguards. Meet the terms of the Local
Plan regarding Regionalized Services.
 Meet the terms of the Local Plan regarding Hospitals, Licensed Children’s Institutions,
and Juvenile Court/Community Schools.
 Meet the terms of the Local Plan regarding costs of Programs and Services, including
Transportation.
 Meet the needs of all enrolled students eligible for special education services.
 Comply with all applicable federal and state laws.
Once deemed a LEA, the Charter School, like all other members of the SELPA, will be responsible
for and entitled to the following:
 Participate in the governance of the SELPA in the same manner as other districts within the
SELPA.
 Participate in and receive regionalized services in the same manner as other districts in
the SELPA.
 Receive State and Federal funding for special education in the same manner as other districts
within the SELPA.
 Be responsible for all costs incurred in the provision of special education services. These
costs may include, but are not limited to, instruction, transportation, County Office special
education placements, non-public school/agency placements, residential placements,
inter/intra SELPA placements, due process proceedings, complaints and attorney fees.
 Document that all State and Federal special education funds apportioned to the Charter School
are used for the sole purpose of providing special education instruction and/or services to
identified students with disabilities. Such funds shall be used to supplement and not supplant
other sources of Federal, State and local funds apportioned to Charter Schools.
Issues requiring conflict resolution related to governance and administration will be reviewed
by the SELPA Director of Special Education Operations Committee and referred to the
Executive Council of Superintendents, if necessary.

SPECIAL EDUCATION INTER-DISTRICT TRANSFER PROCEDURE
1. INTRODUCTION
As part of the Special Education Local Plan Areas I’s, II’s, III’s, IV’s, and VII’s efforts to
coordinate the provision of a full continuum of special education and related services
options, and as a means of ensuring that students with disabilities receive a free and
appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment, districts may
enter into agreements whereby students can be placed in other district special education
programs where the IEP team deems it appropriate (“IEP Team referrals”). In addition,
students receiving special education services may seek to attend school in a district
other than their district of residence via a parent request (“inter-district transfers”). A
uniform method of handling these IEP Team referrals and inter-district transfers among
member districts will promote a fast, efficient and fair functioning of the inter-district
school attendance system in Santa Clara County; which benefit will accrue to the
affected students.
It is the intent of the parties to this policy that students with disabilities are treated in a
manner equal to their non-disabled peers in the administration of special education
referrals and related inter-district attendance agreements.
2. DEFINITION OF TERMS
2.1 District of Attendance: The District to which a transfer is sought (“DOA”).
2.2 District of Residence: The District of the Parent(s) residence (“DOR”).
2.3 Parent: The student’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
3. TRANSFER OF PUPILS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF EDUCATION CODE
SECTION 46600 (i.e., inter-district attendance at parents request for reasons other than
employment).
3.1 PROCEDURE
3.1.1 All requests for transfer shall first be approved by the DOR which also constitutes
approval of the payment of costs required to be paid to the DOA under this
policy.
CHAPTER 14
14.18
Page 2 of 5
3.1.2 All approved requests for transfer shall be submitted to potential DOA’s
representative for consideration on the basis of available classroom space and
other non-arbitrary criteria determined by the DOA.
3.1.3 School assignment for accepted transfers shall be designated by the DOA’s
representative on the basis of available classroom space and other criteria
determined by the DOA.
3.2 ACCEPTANCE/DENIAL CONSIDERATIONS
3.2.1 Nothing in these procedures requires a district to admit a student under an interdistrict
transfer. However, denial of an inter-district transfer request cannot be
based upon race, ethnicity, sex, disability, parental income, scholastic
achievement or other arbitrary consideration. Non-arbitrary considerations,
such as class/program space or availability, are proper considerations for the
acceptance/denial decision.
3.2.2. A pupil who has been determined by personnel of either the DOR or DOA to
have been the victim of an act of bullying, as defined in subdivision (r) of Section
48900, committed by a pupil of the DOR shall, at the request of the person having
legal custody of the pupil, be given priority for interdistrict attendance.
3.3 DURATION/RENEWAL
3.3.1 Transfers under this Section are for a maximum duration of one year, and parents
of students seeking such an inter-district transfer must reapply each year for the
requested transfer. However, a DOR or a DOA shall not rescind existing transfer
permits for pupils entering grade 11 or 12 in the subsequent school year after
June 30 following completion of the student’s 10th grade year.
3.3.2 Individual transfer agreements may stipulate terms and conditions established
by the DOR and DOA under which the permit may be revoked, in compliance
with law.
3.4 INTER-DISTRICT RESPONSIBILITIES
3.4.1 Except as enumerated in Education Code §46607, the DOA shall receive credit
for the average daily attendance of students transferred to it under this section.
3.4.2 All costs for special education students, (over and above ADA), shall be the
responsibility of the DOR, and the DOA shall bill the DOR pursuant to the SELPA
Cost Calculation Formula.
3.4.3 Any and all costs for special education initial assessment of a student not
previously identified as a student with a disability under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C.
CHAPTER 14
14.18
Page 3 of 5
§1400 et seq., required by the student shall be the primary responsibility of the
DOA.
3.4.4 The DOR shall be notified with regard to any assessment of the student, and
shall be notified of the connected IEP team meeting in a timely manner.
3.4.5 If a student is deemed eligible and in need of special education and related
services, the DOA will provide special education and related services for the
remainder of the school year. The DOA will bill the DOR for services provided
pursuant to the SELPA Cost Calculation Formula. Any decision, initial or
otherwise, to place in a non-public school or other out of DOA placement such
as COE shall include and be approved by the DOR, and any resulting such
placement shall be the responsibility of the DOR from the date of the
placement.
3.4.6 The DOR should be notified of all IEP meetings held for a special education
student. The DOR should be invited to such IEP meetings if the IEP involves
the DOR (ex., possible placement in an out-of-district program, addition of
significant services, potential/imminent return to DOR, etc.)
3.5 DENIAL NOTIFICATION
3.5.1 Upon denial of an inter-district transfer request, the student shall have appeal
rights pursuant to Education Code §46601. Student should be informed of
these appeal rights.
4. TRANSFER OF PUPILS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF EDUCATION CODE
SECTION 48204 (i.e., inter-district attendance based upon employment-related
reasons).
4.1 PROCEDURE
4.1.1 The student’s parent must provide acceptable verification of employment
within the boundaries of the potential DOA. Employment must be for a
minimum of 10 hours during the school week.
4.1.2 All requests for transfer shall first be approved by the DOR.
4.1.3 All approved by the DOR, requests for transfer shall be submitted to the
potential DOA’s director of special education for review and action.
4.1.4 If the transfer is approved by the DOA, school assignment shall be designated
by the DOA’s representative on the basis of available classroom space and other
criteria determined by the DOA.
4.1.5 The parents of a student accepted for transfer under this section must
immediately notify the DOR and DOA administrators in the event of the
CHAPTER 14
14.18
Page 4 of 5
termination of his/her employment within the boundaries of the DOA. This
shall result in the expiration of any transfer agreement. The parent may request
continuance of the attendance in the DOA on an Education Code §46600 basis
for the remainder of the current school year.
4.2 ACCEPTANCE/DENIAL CONSIDERATIONS
4.2.1 Nothing in these procedures requires a district to admit a student claiming
residence based upon parental employment to its schools. The district may not,
however, refuse to admit students based upon race, ethnicity, sex, disability,
parental income, scholastic achievement or other arbitrary consideration.
4.2.2 A request may be denied based upon inadequate employment verification.
4.2.3 A request may be denied based upon inadequate classroom space.
4.2.4 Either the DOA or the DOR may prohibit the transfer if the governing board
determines that the transfer would negatively impact the district’s courtordered
or voluntary desegregation plan.
4.2.5 The DOA may prohibit the transfer if there is a determination that the cost of
educating the pupil would exceed the amount of additional state aid received
as a result of the transfer.
4.2.6 The DOR may prohibit the transfer if the transfer would exceed specified
percentages of average daily attendance for the district as enumerated in
Education Code §48204(b)(6).
4.3 DURATION/RENEWAL
4.3.1 The decision to admit a student pursuant to this section is a matter of
discretion, as enumerated above. However, if a transfer pursuant to this section
is granted, the student is deemed a resident of the DOA. Consequently, so long
as a parent remains employed in the DOA, the student has the right, should
he/she so desire, without reapplication, to attend school in the DOA through
the twelfth grade.
4.4 INTER-DISTRICT RESPONSIBILITIES
4.4.1 Except as enumerated in Education Code §46607, the DOA shall receive credit
for the average daily attendance of students transferred to it under this section.
4.4.2 Any and all costs for special education services required by the student during
the duration of the transfer shall be the responsibility of the DOA, which is also
deemed the DOR.
CHAPTER 14
14.18
Page 5 of 5
4.5 DENIAL NOTIFICATION
4.5.1 The District that prohibits the transfer of a student under this section is
encouraged to identify, and communicate in writing to the student’s parents,
the specific reasons for that determination.

10500–STUDENTS
PROGRAM TRANSFER POLICY Policy 10506
According to Education Code Section 56207, special education programs may be
transferred from the Santa Clara County Office of Education (SCCOE) to school
districts, from school districts to the SCCOE and from one school district to another.
I. Definition of a Formal Program Transfer
A program change is presumptively considered a program transfer if either A or
B is met:
A. Transfer of Students from a Single Class
1) The proposed change involves the movement of students from one
service provider LEA to another when the LEA is expanding their
service to replicate a program;
2) The change involves the movement of funding locally from one service
provider LEA to another; and
3) The change involves one or more employees who would be affected by
the provisions of Education Code Section 44903.7. (Section 44903.7
establishes the right of certificated employees to retain employment if
their assignment moves to another LEA.
B. Transfer of Students from Multiple Classes
The transfer of students from several classes combined to form an intact,
identifiable class or an itinerant caseload which involves one or more
employees who would be affected by the provisions of Education Code
Section 44903.7.
If one or more employees will be laid off due to a program transfer of
students from multiple classes, the employment rights specified in Section
X(A)(1) shall be offered to employees based upon seniority.
II. Time Lines and Approval Process
The timeline for submitting and processing transfer requests will vary depending
on whether the LEA is requesting regular or fast track. Regular track requests
will not take effect before the first day of the second fiscal year following the year
in which the request is filed with the SELPA (e.g., a request made in September
2008, if approved, would take effect on July 1, 2010). Fast track requests may
take place as early as the first day of the first fiscal year following the year in
CHAPTER 14
14.19
Page 2 of 5
which the request is filed (e.g.., a request made in September 2008, if approved,
would take effect on July 1, 2009).
Regular Track Timeline
For a regular track transfer, the proposed receiving LEA (i.e., the LEA that will provide
the service) shall submit a letter to the proposed sending LEA (i.e., the LEA that will no
longer provide services) and SELPA AU by June 30.
Fast Track Timeline
For a fast track transfer, the proposed receiving LEA shall submit a letter to the
proposed sending LEA and the SELPA AU prior to October 1
If the LEA decides not take back a program they must notify the provider LEA by
February 15th.
III. Transfer Guidelines
Prior to transferring special education programs from one LEA to another, the
receiving LEA will implement the plan described in the preceding section. The
plan will address all of the following (Reference E.C. Section 56207):
A. Pupil needs
B. The availability of a full continuum of services to affected pupils
C. The functional continuation of the current IEPs of all affected pupils
D. The provision of services in the least restrictive environment from which
affected pupils can benefit
E. The maintenance of all appropriate services
F. The assurance that there will be compliance with all federal and state laws
and regulations and special education local plan areas policies
G. The means through which parents and staff were represented in the planning
process.
IV. Funding
SELPA member districts will be informed in a timely manner of any fiscal
implications of the resulting program transfer.
V. Facilities
Transfer of facilities, when appropriate, will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis
by the sending and receiving LEA.
CHAPTER 14
14.19
Page 3 of 5
VI. Materials and Equipment
Materials and equipment will remain with the sending LEA unless otherwise
agreed upon by the sending and receiving LEA. Any material or equipment
purchased with Low Incidence funds is the property of the CDE and will remain
with the student.
VII. Student Records
When the transfer of a program is completed the sending and receiving LEA will
develop a plan for the transfer of all student records to the receiving LEA.
VII. Disputes
Whenever there is a dispute within the SELPA over the transfer of special
education programs as described above, the involved LEA will follow the
dispute resolution procedures described in the governance section of the SELPA
local plan.
IX. Certificated/Classified Employee Transfers
Employee’s rights when transferred, terminated, or reassigned as a result of a
program transfer:
A. Procedures
When a program is being transferred from one LEA to another, the
receiving LEA will observe the following procedures:
1) The position will be offered to the person who is currently assigned to the
program being transferred, provided in the case of a certificated employee
that s/he is credentialed to hold that position.
2) This offer must be accepted or declined by March 1st. If the employee
chooses to accept the position in the receiving LEA, then the governing
board of the receiving LEA shall, at its first Board meeting in March,
approve an offer of employment effective July 1st. The employee shall
then tender his or her resignation with the sending LEA no later than
March 1st to be effective June 30th.
B. Seniority for transferred or reassigned employees:
If an employee accepts employment with the receiving LEA, such
employee shall retain the same seniority date and classification that the
employee held with the sending LEA.

priority in being informed of and in filling certificated positions in special
education in the areas in which the employee is certificated within the
LEA or county office by which the certificated employee is then currently
employed.
2) Classified Employees: A classified employee who is reassigned or
transferred has priority, for a 24 month period, in being informed of and
in filling classified positions in the classification in which the employee
was employed before the reassignment or transfer.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY SELPAs
SCCOE SPECIAL EDUCATION HOUSING POLICY
This policy covers housing for programs operated by the SCCOE Special Education Department on district
operated sites. The policy shall apply to programs operated by SCCOE for three (3) to twenty-two (22) year
old students and does not pertain to Regional Programs operated by districts. The policy shall remain in effect
unless modified and approved by all SELPA Executive Councils in Santa Clara County.
I. INTRODUCTION
The districts of the Santa Clara County SELPAs are committed to the provision of special education services to
all students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment as required by State and Federal law. It is the
districts' obligation to assure that when it is not possible for students with disabilities to be educated in their
home schools, they receive the services specified in their IEPs in classrooms located as close to their homes as
possible. This goal is intended to fulfill the SELPA's purpose that the students and staff be included to the
greatest extent possible as a part of the school community. To fulfill this commitment, the districts shall provide
classroom space for all special education students in Santa Clara County.
Each school district accepts the ultimate responsibility for providing classroom facilities, or the financial
resources to provide classroom facilities, for the special education students residing within its boundaries. A
district may join with other districts in its area to provide classroom space or the financial support to house their
students. The classroom needs of all students, both general and special education must be considered in all
decisions regarding the allocation of classroom space. There may be times when a school district offers
classroom space, which is not utilized by SCCOE (see page 2, item #7).
Maximum effort will be made to avoid the over representation of special education classes on an individual
school site. In addition, classrooms should be located to promote natural opportunities for students with
disabilities to participate with chronologically age-appropriate, general education students in academic, nonacademic
and extra-curricular activities to the maximum extent appropriate for the needs of both the special and
general education students.
II. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
The Santa Clara County SELPAs will be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of this policy. The
SCCOE Special Education Department will assume responsibility for determination of classrooms owed and
provided by each district, and will collaborate with the SELPA offices in the calculation and collection of
housing fees and disbursement of housing compensation.
2
III. PROVISION OF CLASSROOM SPACE BY DISTRICTS
A. Calculation of Projected Classroom Space Needed by Districts
Classroom space needed for those programs specified in this policy will be calculated using the following
procedure:
1. The SCCOE Special Education Department’s May 1st enrollment projections for the following year will
serve as the basis for estimating the classroom space owed by each district in the subsequent school year.
2. Actual determination of housing obligations will be based on current year December-April average
enrollment in SCCOE Special Education programs.
3. The number of pupils constituting one classroom for the purpose of the Housing Policy will be
recommended each year by the Facilities Rate Setting Committee and approved in the SELPA Budget
Allocation Plans along with Rate per class and percentage credit for land-only.
4. When the Santa Clara County Office of Education owns or leases a portable classroom located on district
operated site, that classroom will generate partial credit toward the calculation of the district’s housing
obligation.
5. Each district will have two options for fulfilling its housing obligation.
 The provision of classroom space. This is the preferable option.
 In the event that a district does not provide the obligated classroom space, it will be charged a housing
fee.
 A SELPA may exercise the option of “pooling” member district obligations and/or compensation for
space.
6. When a district exceeds its housing obligation by providing additional classroom space, the district will be
paid the approved housing compensation rate.
7. Classroom space offered by the district must not only meet the standards specified in this policy, but must
also be appropriate to the needs of the program operator.
Criteria for appropriateness include the following:
 the classroom offered provides for interaction with nondisabled peers
 usage of the classroom offered does not result in unusual additional costs to the SCCOE Special
Education program
 usage of the classroom minimizes transportation time and cost
 there should be a sufficient population projections to sustain the classroom for at least three years
 there shall be minimal disruption or displacement for students in existing programs.
3
B. Contracts for Provision of Classroom Space
1. By February 28 of each year, districts will notify the SCCOE-Special Education Department of their
intention to reclaim classroom space.
2. Negotiations between the SCCOE Special Education Department and districts for new contracts or other
arrangements to provide classroom space shall be completed by May 30th of each year.
3. Contracts for classroom space shall be for a specific classroom site and it is recommended that it be for a
minimum of three (3) years. The use of classrooms for Extended School Year programs is included in the
contracts. The relocation of classrooms for Extended School Year programs shall be negotiated between
the district and SCCOE Special Education Department by April 15.
4. Termination of contracts prior to their expiration date shall be by mutual consent of the district and SCCOE
Special Education Department.
C. Standard for Classrooms
Classrooms provided by district, as a means of fulfilling their housing obligations shall meet the following standards,
as appropriate:
1. One classroom (approximately 960 square feet) will be provided in accordance with established State and
Federal standards (i.e., applicable Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility standards, Health and Safety
Codes, fire alarm requirements, and Field Act standards, or a waiver of Field Act standards.
2. Running hot water will be provided in all classrooms where the availability of water within the classroom
is necessary to meet the health and safety needs of the students, as determined by the SCCOE Special
Education Department. Example: An accommodation for hot water could be an instant hot water heater.
3. Heat and Air Conditioning will be provided in all classrooms where the availability of heat and air
conditioning within the classroom is necessary to meet the health and safety needs of the students, as
determined by the SCCOE Special Education Department.
4. In-class toilet facilities will be provided as appropriate for the age and the needs of the students and as
determined by the SCCOE Special Education Department with the approval of the district.
Students will have access to toileting facilities on campus available to all other students.
It is the intent of this policy to respect the privacy rights of special education students, which accord them
with basic human dignity.
The toilet and/or changing area shall be large enough to accommodate personal hygiene activities.
5. Any site modifications, if needed, will be negotiated between the SCCOE Special Education Department
and the district prior to modifications taking place.
6. The site will provide internet access in each classroom. SCCOE Special Education classrooms need
comparable Internet access, as do the host site classrooms. SCCOE will be provided with one static IP
4
address and one live Ethernet jack in each Special Education classroom to set up VPN technology in each
classroom.
D. Custodial Services
Custodial service, including daily classroom cleaning for all classrooms, including portables, whether district or
SCCOE owned, shall be the responsibility of the district. The SCCOE Special Education Department will provide
information regarding recommended daily classroom cleaning as identified in the State publication, “State
Guidelines and Procedures for Meeting the Specialized Physical Health Care Needs of Pupils.”, and designated by
level of need of classroom. (see attached).
E. Maintenance
Maintenance service shall be the responsibility of the owner of the facility. This includes regularly scheduled and
preventative classroom maintenance such as filter replacements, carpet cleaning, floor polishing, light bulb
replacements, etc.
F. Repairs
Classroom repair due to normal wear for such items as plumbing, windows, locks, roofs, ,cooling and heating
systems, etc. shall be the responsibility of the owner of the facility.
Repairs of the facility for any damage caused by the program staff and/or students and repairs of the personal
property owned by the program shall be the responsibility of the SCCOE Special Education Department.
G. Relocation of Classrooms
In the event a district has to relocate a SCCOE Special Education Department classroom due to planned
renovations, fire, natural disaster, vandalism or other emergency situations when the classroom is unsuitable for
housing students, the district remains responsible for providing adequate temporary housing until repairs can be
completed. The district will make every effort to house the students on the same school site.
With respect to moving costs for COE classrooms, the following will apply:
 Fire or natural disaster: Insurance will be billed. If no insurance, cost will be borne centrally.
 Renovation by district: Cost will be borne centrally.
 COE moves class during ESY for safety: Cost will be borne centrally.
 District decision to consolidate classrooms for summer: Cost will be borne by district or district will move

IV. PROVISION OF NEW CLASSROOMS BY THE DISTRICT OR SCCOE SPECIAL EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT ON DISTRICT PROPERTY
A. New Construction by COE on District Property Requiring 40 Year Lease. The housing policy
section concerning new construction (40 year leases): shall be reviewed every two years beginning
with the 2007-08 school year.
5
Option 1
COE provides the custodial and utilities. District receives 45% credit times current agreed upon
facilities housing rate times the number of actual classrooms provided.
Option 2
COE provides utilities and district provides custodial. District receives 71% credit times current
agreed upon facilities housing rate times the number of actual classrooms provided.
B. When constructing new classrooms or acquiring a new portable, not requiring a 40 year lease, the
SCCOE Special Education Department and the district will meet to negotiate any one-time cost.
For example:
 Site preparation
 Water and sewer hook-up
 Architectural and other fees
Classrooms provided by new construction shall meet all of the requirements specified in Section IIIC, Standards for
Classrooms.
V. RESPONSIBILITY FOR PORTABLE CLASSROOMS PLACED BY THE SCCOE SPECIAL EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT ON DISTRICT PROPERTY
When the SCCOE Special Education Department brings a portable onto district property, the following shall apply:
1. SCCOE Special Education Department shall be responsible for all requirements specified in Section IIIC
(Standards for Classrooms).
2. Custodial service, including daily classroom cleaning for all classrooms, shall be the responsibility of the
district or negotiated between the district and SCCOE Special Education Department. The SCCOE Special
Education Department will provide information regarding daily classroom cleaning as identified in the State
publication, “State Guidelines and Procedures for Meeting the Specialized Physical Health Care Needs of
Pupils.”
3. Whenever possible, actual maintenance/repair shall be provided by the local school district. Cost for
maintenance service, classroom repair due to normal wear and tear or any site improvements should be the
responsibility of the SCCOE Special Education Department or negotiated between the SCCOE Special
Education Department and the district.
VI. FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
1. Districts are obligated to provide classroom space (or financial resources to provide classroom space) for
the number of resident students enrolled in SCCOE Special Education Department operated programs.
This obligation includes classroom space, utilities, custodial services and such maintenance and repair as
specified in this document.
6
2. The SELPA facilities committee each year will recommend the value to be placed on classrooms provided,
which are over or under a district’s obligation. The value placed will be in consideration of the following
factors: average cost of utilities, average cost of custodial services and routine maintenance/repair, average
cost of a leased portable, and reasonable lease rate for classroom space on an open school campus. The
value placed on classrooms, and the fraction thereof allowable for land (utilities and custodial/maintenance
service) shall be pending approval of all SELPA Executive Councils in the county.
a) The Facilities Rate Setting Committee will meet prior to March of each year to
recommend and finalize the rate/number of pupils per class and percentage of credit for
land-only for the following year. The rate suggested at the December 2010 meeting will
stay in effect for the 2011-2012 year.
b) The committee will be comprised of district special education program and fiscal
representatives. The intention of the committee is to reach agreement using the
following priorities:
 Consensus of all present at the Facilities Rate Setting Meeting with a quorum
consisting of representation from all SELPAs and a minimum of five fiscal
and/or program administrators from Southeast and five fiscal and/or program
administrators from Northwest SELPAs.
 Dispute resolution (SELPA Directors, and an outside mediator)
c) The SELPA AU Directors and SCCOE Special Education staffs are not members of the
committee that decides consensus.
3. Housing fees for the number of spaces that a district is short of its obligation will be added to the estimate
of cost of COE programs for that district. Housing compensation for the number of spaces that a district
provides, which are over its obligation, will be estimated, but not credited against, the district’s cost of
COE programs. This amount will be a Revenue Transfer for Housing Compensation at the end of each
year.
4. SELPA Fiscal Advisors will assess the Excess or Deficit in revenue resulting from the Housing Policy at
the end of each year looking only at the year to either refund any excess or collect from districts any deficit
when the excess or deficit is greater than or equal to the current facilities rate for a COE classroom. In that
case, the entire excess will be distributed or deficit charged back based on current pupil count used in
facility cost calculations. This process began in 2008-2009 and will continue annually thereafter. Included
in the assessment will be other contract costs related to Facility costs, moving expenses, set-up and remodel
fees and indirect costs. Also included will be other lease revenue collected by SCCOE Special Education.
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE
1. An Oversight Committee will be established that is composed of SELPA Directors and SCCOE Director
of Special Education.
2. The Oversight Committee will be responsible for the following:
7
 the SELPA Directors and COE Director will meet with district directors to review needs and availability
of classroom space; and
 the Oversight Committee will meet, if necessary, to review appropriateness of offers submitted by
districts for use of classrooms.

LICENSED CHILDREN’S INSTITUTIONS:
This policy applies to student placement in Licensed Children’s Institutions (LCIs) by a
court, regional center or public agency other than a local educational agency (LEA),
pursuant to Education Code §56155 et seq. Students placed in LCIs by an LEA, a parent
or a non-public source are not covered by this policy, as such students remain the
responsibility of the student’s district of residence.
If an LCI student is enrolled in a non-public school (NPS) or a Santa Clara County Office
of Education (SCCOE) alternative school program, that student is the educational
responsibility of the SCCOE. For students enrolled in programs other than an NPS or an
SCCOE alternative school program, the district where the LCI is located is the LEA
responsible for the student’s educational program
FOSTER FAMILY HOMES:
Students with disabilities who are placed in a foster family home as defined in Education
Code 56155.5(b) are the educational responsibility of the district in which the foster
family home is located unless the Student remains in his/her “school of origin” under
Education Code 48853.5. In the case of “school of origin” attendance, the district in
which the school of origin is located retains educational responsibility for the student. If
transportation for a “school of origin” student is required, the involved LEAs will share
responsibility for the cost and/or provision of the required transportation

PROGRAM COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND SUPPORT Policy 10505
Special Education Local Plan Area I, II, III, IV, & VII assure access to special education and
services for all students with disabilities residing in the geographic area served by member districts.
The Executive Council Superintendents, Operations Cabinet, and SELPA Director are responsible
for monitoring the completed plan to verify that each participating Local Education Agency (LEA)
carries out the duties and responsibilities assigned to it within the plan. A combination of factors
must be reviewed to determine the quality of a program or service or the degree to which an agency
is compliant with the intentions of the law. As the State monitors LEAs and takes action to
encourage and enforce compliance, it is incumbent upon the SELPA to precede State sanction with
prevention and intervention activities. Through monitoring of the practices of LEAs, the SELPA
Administrative Unit (AU) can support LEA efforts with targeted prevention activities and
appropriate intervention when necessary.
States are required to establish measurable and rigorous targets for the indicators established by the
Secretary under the priority areas contained in the statute and regulations.
These are specified in the Act (20 U.S.C. 1416 (a)(2)) and must be on:
• Improving educational results and functional outcomes for all children with disabilities.
• Ensuring that public agencies meet the program requirements under Part B of the Act, with
a particular emphasis on those requirements that are most closely related to improving
educational results for children with disabilities.
• States must use quantifiable and qualitative indicators to adequately measure performance
in the priority areas established in the Act.
The 20 indicators established by the Office of Education are derived from the three priority areas
established in the Act (20 U.S.C. 1416 (a)(3)).
1. Provision of FAPE in the least restrictive environment.
2. State exercise of general supervision, including child find, effective monitoring, the use of
resolution meetings, mediation, and a system of transition services as defined in 300.43 and
in U.S.C. 1437(a)(9).
3. Disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related
services, to the extent the representation is the result of inappropriate identification.
CHAPTER 14
14.22
of the 20 indicators required by OSEP, the first 14 are included in the Annual Performance
Report Measures for each LEA. These indicators replace the Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) used previously as part of the State’s Quality Assurance Process.

SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS
INDEPENDENT EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
This policy sets forth the procedures under which students with disabilities are entitled to an Independent
Educational Evaluation (IEE).
Definitions
Independent educational evaluation (IEE): Means an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is
not employed by the LEA responsible for the education of the child in question.
Public expense means that the LEA either pays for the full cost of the evaluation or ensures that the
evaluation is otherwise provided at no cost to the parent, consistent with the law.
General Procedures
A parent (or guardian) has the right to request, at public expense, an IEE of the student from qualified
specialists, as defined by this policy, if the parent disagrees with an assessment obtained by the public
education agency, in accordance with the law.
Each LEA must provide to parents, upon request for an IEE, information about where an IEE may be
obtained, and the agency criteria applicable for IEE as set forth in this policy.
If a parent requests an IEE at public expense, the LEA must, without unnecessary delay, either:
(1) File a due process complaint to request a hearing to demonstrate that its evaluation is appropriate; or
(2) Ensure that an IEE is provided at public expense, unless the agency demonstrates in a due process
hearing that the evaluation obtained by the parent did not meet agency criteria.
If the LEA files a due process complaint to request a hearing and the final decision is that the agency's
evaluation is appropriate, the parent still has the right to an IEE, but not at public expense.
If a parent requests an IEE at public expense, the LEA may ask for the parent's reason why he or she objects
to the public evaluation. However, the LEA may not require the parent to provide an explanation and may
not unreasonably delay either providing the IEE at public expense or filing a due process complaint to
request a due process hearing to defend the public evaluation.
A parent is entitled to request only one IEE at public expense each time the LEA conducts an evaluation
with which the parent disagrees.
Parent-initiated Evaluations
If the parent obtains an IEE at public expense or shares with the LEA an evaluation obtained at private
expense, the results of the evaluation:
(1) Must be considered by the LEA, if it meets agency criteria, in any decision made with respect to the
provision of FAPE to the child; and
CHAPTER 14
14.23
Revised 10/22 Page 2
(2) May be presented by any party as evidence at a hearing on a due process complaint regarding that child.
Requests for Evaluations by Hearing Officers
If a hearing officer requests an IEE as part of a hearing on a due process complaint, the cost of the evaluation
must be at public expense.
LEA Criteria
If an IEE is at public expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including the location of
the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, must be the same as the criteria that the LEA uses
when it initiates an evaluation, to the extent those criteria are consistent with a parent's right to an IEE.
However, a Parent shall always have the opportunity to demonstrate that unique circumstances justify the
selection of an evaluator outside of these criteria. Except for the criteria described in this policy, a LEA
may not impose conditions or timelines related to obtaining an IEE at public expense.
Observation
If the LEA observed the student in conducting the evaluation with which the parent disagrees, or if its
assessment procedures allow in-class observations, the independent evaluator will be provided an
equivalent opportunity to observe the student in the current educational setting, and to observe the LEA’s
proposed setting, if any. This opportunity shall be provided regardless of whether the independent
educational assessment is initiated before or after the filing of a due process hearing proceeding.
The LEA shall define the nature and scope of an independent evaluator’s in-class observations consistent
with the right to an equivalent opportunity to observe, but also consistent with its obligations to prevent
unnecessary disruption in the class and to protect the privacy interests of other students. This may include,
but is not limited to, identifying the time constraints of such observation, LEA personnel who will
participate in the observation and restrictions on student/teacher interactions.
Location Limitations for Evaluators
Evaluators will be located within the greater Bay Area (counties: Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, San
Francisco & Alameda). Evaluators outside of this area will be approved only on an exceptional basis,
providing parents can demonstrate the necessity of using an evaluator outside the specified area. Any
expenses beyond the evaluation (i.e., food, lodging, transportation, etc.) are not covered in the cost of the
independent educational evaluation unless exceptional circumstances are present and reimbursement for
such expenses is specifically agreed upon in writing.

Cost Limitations for Independent Evaluations
The cost of the IEE shall be comparable to those costs that the LEA incurs when it uses its own employees
or contractors to perform similar evaluations unless exceptional circumstances requiring additional costs
are demonstrated. Costs may include: observations, administration and scoring tests, and report writing.
Reimbursement will be in an amount no greater than the actual cost to the parent and will be subject to
proof of payment. SELPA IEE cost limitations can be found here. The LEA and parent can agree to exceed
the cost limitation when exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.
When private insurance will cover all or partial costs of the IEE, the LEA may request that the parent
voluntarily have their insurance pay the covered IEE costs. However, parent will not be asked to have
insurance cover IEE costs if such action would result in a financial cost to the parent not reimbursed by the
LEA, including, but not limited to the following:
1) A decrease in available lifetime coverage or any other benefit under an insurance policy;
2) An increase in premiums or the discontinuance of the policy; or
3) An out-of-pocket expense such as payment of a deductible amount incurred in filing a claim.
In seeking and obtaining parents’ voluntary consent to seek insurance contribution for an IEE, such consent
should be written and should clearly state that the parent:
• Agrees to the LEA's filing of an insurance claim to obtain reimbursement for specifically
identified services.
• Acknowledges that the information and records identified in the request for consent will be
released to specifically identified persons or entities in connection with submitting the claim for
reimbursement.
• Understands that they are not required to consent to the filing of insurance claims and may refuse
to do so at any time in the future.
• Recognizes that any refusal to permit the LEA to access their private insurance does not relieve the
LEA of its obligation to provide all required services at no cost.
As part of the contracted evaluation, independent evaluators may be asked to:
• Attend relevant IEP Team meetings by phone or in person to discuss their findings
• Provide protocols of all the assessments, and
• Provide a written report prior to the IEP Team meeting
CHAPTER 14
14.23
Revised 10/22 Page 5
Independent evaluators must agree to release their assessment information and results to the LEA prior to
receipt of payment for services. The results of the IEE will be considered in the determination of eligibility,
program decisions, and placement of the student with disabilities as required by the IDEA.
All independent educational evaluators should utilize testing and assessment materials and procedures
which are selected and administered so as not to be racially, culturally, or sexually discriminatory. Tests
and other assessment materials should be provided and administered in the student’s primary language or
other mode of communication unless the evaluation plan indicates reasons why this provision and
administration are not clearly feasible. All assessment instruments utilized should have been validated for
the specific purpose for which they are used and be administered by trained personnel in conformity with
the instructions provided by the publisher.
Recommended Procedures for Responding to IEE Requests
Once a parent communicates his/her disagreement with the LEA’s evaluation and requests orally or in
writing an IEE at public expense, the following procedures should be followed:
1. Upon receipt of the request, the LEA will respond and provide the parent with information
about where an IEE may be obtained, and the agency criteria applicable for IEE, by providing
a copy of the SELPA’s IEE Policy and Procedures.
2. Without unnecessary delay following the review of the IEE request, the LEA will respond,
through the provision of prior written notice, regarding its decision to either seek due process
to defend the appropriateness of its assessment or agree to the IEE at public expense.
3. Should the LEA choose to initiate due process to defend the appropriateness of its assessment,
the LEA must do so without unnecessary delay.
4. Should the LEA agree to fund the IEE at public expense, the LEA:
a. May discuss the possible options for obtaining an IEE at public expense with parent,
including the use of:
i. An evaluator from another LEA in the SELPA;
ii. An evaluator from another SELPA; or
iii. A private sector evaluator.
Ultimately, if an IEE is agreed to be funded, parents have the choice of the assessor to be
used (so long as the chosen assessor meets the criteria in this policy).
b. Should seek confirmation in writing of parent’s decision/agreement to pursue the IEE and
the agreed upon method of payment/delivery (e.g., contract, parent reimbursement).
c. Should seek a signed release and exchange of information between the independent
evaluator(s) and the LEA.
Should the parent at any time obtain an IEE at either public or private expense, the LEA must hold an IEP
meeting with the student’s relevant IEP team members to discuss and consider the IEE results.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY SELPAs I, II, III, IV & VII
SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS
EMERGENCY INTERVENTION BEHAVIOR POLICY
The Santa Clara County SELPAs recognize that the state has continually sought to provide an appropriate
and meaningful educational program in a safe and healthy environment for all children regardless of
possible physical, mental, or emotionally disabling conditions. Further, the Santa Clara County SELPAs
recognize that some school-age individuals with exceptional needs have significant behavioral challenges
that have an adverse impact on their learning or the learning of other pupils, or both. Research and
experience demonstrate that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by
providing incentives for positive behavioral interventions and supports to address the learning and
behavioral needs of those children, and that procedures for the elimination of maladaptive behaviors shall
not include those deemed unacceptable under the law or those that cause pain or trauma.
It is the intent of this policy that:
1. Children exhibiting serious behavioral challenges receive timely and appropriate assessments and
positive supports and interventions in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (IDEA) and its implementing regulations.
2. Assessments and positive behavioral interventions and supports be developed and implemented in
a manner informed by guidance from the United States Department of Education and technical
assistance centers sponsored by the Office of Special Education Programs of the United States
Department of Education.
3. When behavioral interventions, supports, and other strategies are used, they be used in consideration
of the pupil's physical freedom and social interaction, be administered in a manner that respects
human dignity and personal privacy, and that ensure a pupil's right to placement in the least
restrictive educational environment.
4. Behavioral intervention plans be developed and used, to the extent possible, in a consistent manner
when the pupil is also the responsibility of another agency for residential care or related services.
5. Training programs be developed and implemented in institutions of higher education that train
teachers and that in-service training programs be made available as necessary in school districts and
county offices of education to ensure that adequately trained staff are available to work effectively
with the behavioral intervention needs of individuals with exceptional needs.
In the case of a child whose behavior impeded the child’s learning or that of others, the individualized
education program team shall consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and
other strategies, to address that behavior, consistent with Section 1414(d)(3)(B)(i) and (d)(4) of Tile 20
of the Unified States Code and associated federal regulations.
Definitions
• Behavioral restraint includes mechanical restraint or physical restraint used as an intervention when
a student presents an immediate danger to self or to others. Behavioral restraint does not include
postural restraints or devices used to improve a student's mobility and independent functioning
rather than to restrict movement. (Education Code 49005.1)
• Mechanical restraint means the use of a device or equipment to restrict a student's freedom of
movement. Mechanical restraint does not include the use of devices as prescribed by an appropriate
medical or related service professional, including, but not limited to, adaptive devices or
CHAPTER 14
14.24
2
mechanical supports used to achieve proper body position, balance, or alignment; vehicle safety
restraints during the transport of a student; restraints for medical immobilization; or orthopedically
prescribed devices which permit a student to participate in activities without risk of harm.
Mechanical restraint also does not include the use of devices by peace officers or security personnel
for detention or for public safety purposes. (Education Code 49005.1)
• Physical restraint means a personal restriction that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a student
to move the torso, arms, legs, or head freely. Physical restraint does not include a physical escort
in which a staff member temporarily touches or holds the student's hand, wrist, arm, shoulder, or
back for the purpose of inducing a student who is acting out to walk to a safe location. Physical
restraint also does not include the use of force by peace officers or security personnel for detention
or for public safety purposes. (Education Code 49005.1)
• Prone restraint means the application of a behavioral restraint on a student in a facedown position.
(Education Code 49005.1)
• Seclusion means the involuntary confinement of a student alone in a room or an area from which
the student is physically prevented from leaving. Seclusion does not include a timeout involving
the monitored separation of the student in an unlocked setting, which is implemented for the
purpose of calming the student. (Education Code 49005.1)
Emergency Interventions
Emergency interventions shall not be used as a substitute for the systematic behavioral intervention plan
that is designed to change, replace, modify, or eliminate a targeted behavior. Emergency interventions
shall not include an amount of force that exceeds that which is reasonable and necessary under the
circumstances.
Emergency interventions, including seclusion and/or a behavioral restraint, may only be used to control
unpredictable, spontaneous behavior that poses clear and present danger of serious physical harm to the
individual with exceptional needs, or others, and that cannot be immediately prevented by a response less
restrictive than the temporary application of a technique used to contain the behavior.
No emergency intervention shall be employed for longer than is necessary to contain the behavior that
poses a clear and present danger of serious physical harm to the pupil or others. A situation that requires
prolonged use of an emergency intervention shall require the staff to seek assistance of the school site
administrator or law enforcement agency, as applicable to the situation.
Staff shall afford to pupils who are restrained the least restrictive alternative and the maximum freedom of
movement, and shall use the least number of restraint points, while ensuring the physical safety of the
pupil and others.
Prohibited Interventions
Staff shall avoid the use of seclusion and behavioral restraint of students whenever possible. Seclusion
and behavioral restraint of students shall not be used in any form as a means of coercion, discipline,
convenience, or retaliation. (Education Code 49005.8).
A local educational agency or nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency serving individuals with
exceptional needs pursuant to Sections 56365 and 56366, shall not authorize, order, consent to, or pay for
the following interventions, or any other interventions similar to or like the following:
1. Administer a drug that is not a standard treatment for a student's medical or psychiatric condition
in order to control the student's behavior or restrict the student's freedom of movement
CHAPTER 14
14.24
3
2. Use locked seclusion unless it is in a facility otherwise licensed or permitted by state law to use as
a locked room.
3. Use a physical restraint technique that obstructs a student's respiratory airway or impairs a student's
breathing or respiratory capacity, including a technique in which a staff member places pressure on
the student's back or places his/her body weight against the student's torso or back
4. Use a behavioral restraint technique that restricts breathing, including, but not limited to, the use
of a pillow, blanket, carpet, mat, or other item to cover a student's face
5. Place a student in a facedown position with the student's hands held or restrained behind the
student's back
6. Use a behavioral restraint for longer than is necessary to contain the behavior that poses a clear and
present danger of serious physical harm to the student or others.
7. Any intervention that is designed to, or likely to, cause physical pain, including, but not limited to,
electric shock.
8. An intervention that involves the release of noxious, toxic, or otherwise unpleasant sprays, mists,
or substances in proximity to the face of the individual.
9. An intervention that denies adequate sleep, food, water, shelter, bedding, physical comfort, or
access to bathroom facilities.
10. An intervention that is designed to subject, used to subject, or likely to subject, the individual to
verbal abuse, ridicule, or humiliation, or that can be expected to cause excessive emotional trauma.
11. Restrictive interventions that employ a device, material, or objects that simultaneously immobilize
all four extremities, including the procedure known as prone containment.
12. An intervention that precludes adequate supervision of the individual.
13. An intervention that deprives the individual of one or more of his or her senses.
Limited Use of Seclusion or Restraint
Staff shall avoid the use of seclusion and behavioral restraint of students whenever possible. Seclusion or
behavioral restraint may be used only to control student behavior that poses a clear and present danger of
serious physical harm to the student or others, which cannot be prevented by a response that is less
restrictive. (Education Code 49005.4, 49005.6, 49005.8)
If a student is put in seclusion, the student shall be under constant, direct observation of a staff member.
Such observation may be through a window or another barrier through which the staff member is able to
make direct eye contact with the student but shall not be made through indirect means such as a security
camera or closed-circuit television. (Education Code 49005.8)
If a student is restrained, staff shall afford the student the least restrictive alternative and the maximum
freedom of movement, and shall use the least number of restraint points, while ensuring the physical
safety of the student and others. (Education Code 49005.8) Another staff member who is not involved in
the restraint must be present and shall be responsible for monitoring the well-being of the student.
Behavior Emergency Reports
To prevent emergency interventions from being used in lieu of planned, systematic behavioral
interventions, the parent, guardian, and residential care provider, if appropriate, shall be notified within
one school day if an emergency intervention, including seclusion and/or a behavioral restraint is used, or
serious property damage occurs. A behavioral emergency report shall immediately be completed and
CHAPTER 14
14.24
4
maintained in the file of the individual with exceptional needs. The behavioral emergency report shall
include all the following:
1. The name and age of the individual with exceptional needs.
2. The setting and location of the incident.
3. The name of the staff or other persons involved.
4. A description of the incident and the emergency intervention used, and whether the individual with
exceptional needs is currently engaged in any systematic behavioral intervention plan.
5. Details of any injuries sustained by the individual with exceptional needs, or others, including staff,
as a result of the incident.
All behavioral emergency reports shall immediately be forwarded to, and reviewed by, a designated
responsible administrator.
If a behavioral emergency report is written regarding an individual with exceptional needs who does not
have a behavioral intervention plan, the designated responsible administrator shall, within two days,
schedule an individualized education program (IEP) team meeting to review the emergency report, to
determine the necessity for a functional behavioral assessment, and to determine the necessity for an
interim plan. The IEP team shall document the reasons for not conducting the functional behavioral
assessment, not developing an interim plan, or both.
If a behavioral emergency report is written regarding an individual with exceptional needs who has a
positive behavioral intervention plan, an incident involving a previously unseen serious behavior problem,
or where a previously designed intervention is ineffective, shall be referred to the IEP team to review and
determine if the incident constitutes a need to modify the positive behavioral intervention plan.
Use of Board-Certified Behavior Analyst
A person recognized by the national Behavior Analyst Certification Board as a Board-Certified Behavior
Analyst may conduct behavior assessments and provide behavioral intervention services for individuals
with exceptional needs.
A district, special education local plan area, or county office is not required to use a Board-Certified
Behavior Analyst to conduct behavior assessments and provide behavioral intervention services for
individuals with exceptional needs.
Nothing in this policy prohibits a SELPA member Local Education Agency (LEA) from prohibiting
additional behavioral interventions through the LEA’s own board policies/administrative regulations.

COMPONENTS OF
RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION (RtI)
The reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 2004 (IDEA)
focused national attention on a growing practice in the general education classroom –
Response to Intervention (RtI) as a tool for assessing and providing high quality
instruction to all struggling learners and to students at risk for academic failure. The RtI
process is a multi-tiered approach to providing interventions to students who struggle
with learning at increased levels of intensity based on progress monitoring and data
analysis. It is proactive and responsive system that provides intervention based on the
integration of all resources and shared expertise to more completely respond to student
needs. The RtI process has the potential to limit the amount of academic failure that any
student experiences and to increase the accuracy of special education evaluations. This
could also reduce the number of children who have been mistakenly identified as
having learning disabilities when their learning problems are actually due to cultural
differences or lack of adequate instruction. Information and data gathered by an RtI
process can lead to early identification of children who have true disabilities and are in
need of special education services. Successful implementation of RtI requires a number
of essential components that ensure high-quality instruction, careful monitoring and
documenting of progress, and close collaboration between general education and
special education.
Essential Components of an RtI model
1. High Quality, Research-Based Instruction
The first critical component of RtI is that it’s essential that students receive researchbased
classroom instruction in the general education classroom implemented by the
general education teacher.
2. Universal Screening
Universal screenings are given to ALL children three times a year beginning in midkindergarten
and are used to pinpoint early academic difficulties. Procedures must
identify which students are proficient in the target skill, which students are developing
the skill (strategic), and which students are deficient in the skill (intensive). It is
recommended that you develop “benchmark” data norms either from national norms or
from the classroom, grade level, school, and district.
3. Problem Solving Teams/Student Study Teams
A Problem-Solving Team is a school-based group composed of various school
personnel, such as teachers, counselors, school psychologist, and administrators, who
CHAPTER 15
15.3
Reviewed July 2012
meet to provide assistance to children who are having academic or behavioral
difficulties in school. This team is responsible for implementing a problem-solving
approach to identify and intervene in response to student’s needs in the general
education setting. Schools should involve parents at the earliest stages of RtI by
explaining the process and providing written intervention plans and progress towards
intervention goals. The nature of problem-solving involves a systematic approach that
reviews student strengths and weaknesses, identifies evidence-based instructional
interventions, frequently collects data to monitor student progress, and evaluates the
effectiveness of interventions implemented with the student. Problem-solving is a
sequence of steps starting with defining and describing a problem using screening and
diagnostic assessments; developing a plan by setting goals and generating potential
solutions; and implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the effectiveness of the
selected intervention.
4. Assessments
Assessment is the formal or informal process of systematically observing, gathering,
and recording credible information to help answer evaluation questions and make
decisions. There are three primary assessments used during the RtI process: screening,
diagnostic, and progress monitoring. Screening assessments identify which students are
at risk of academic failure and may need additional assessment. Diagnostic assessments
give more in-depth information about the student’s strengths, weaknesses, and a
probable cause of the problem. By examining the results of diagnostic assessment,
teachers can determine where to begin instruction and what concepts or skills to
emphasize. Diagnostic assessments may include more traditional, standardized, or
functional assessments. Progress monitoring assessments are conducted on a routine
basis to monitor the adequacy of progress form the instructional interventions.
Assessment results should be strongly related to planning interventions. Assessments
can be used to help teachers make decisions about changes to instructional strategies,
judgments about student progress, and to determine where further instruction is
necessary for individuals or groups.
5. Outcome Oriented Research-Based Interventions
When a student’s progress indicates a difficulty, teachers should determine what
scientifically, research-based interventions and instruction matches the student’s need. .
These interventions may include, for example, and intensive “double dose” or
instruction or a different instructional method. Resources, curricula, and interventions
must be available across the academic domains. Collaborative relationship between
staff members is needed to develop, implement, and monitor the intervention with
adequate amount of intensity and fidelity.
Written intervention plans should delineate:
CHAPTER 15
15.3
Reviewed July 2012
• A description of the specific intervention being used (scientific, research-based
intervention)
• The duration of the intervention (8-12 weeks, 30 minutes/day)
• The schedule and setting of the intervention
• The people who are responsible for implementing the intervention
• Measurable outcomes which can be used to make data-based adjustments as
needed during the intervention process
• A description of the skill measurement and recording techniques
• A progress monitoring schedule (e.g. once/week) and results in quantitative data
6. Ongoing Progress Monitoring and Systematic Data-Based Decision Making
Progress is monitored towards an observable, measurable, and ambitious goal for 8-12
weeks. During this time, data can be collected from multiple methods of progress
monitoring, such as curriculum-based, functional, or classroom assessments. The
method of collecting this data must be reliable, valid, and include sufficient alternate
forms and criteria needed for judging the adequacy of progress. The data and progress
are graphed and viewed regularly. Data decision rules are used to evaluate the
effectiveness of interventions and determine when modifications to interventions are
needed. To determine whether an intervention is effective and to make any
modifications to it, teachers must frequently and continually monitor progress by
collecting data. Data is regularly analyzed to make decisions regarding student
progress toward measurable goals allowing for changes in strategies, methods, and
interventions as needed. The data will provide a cumulative record of the student’s
response to the intervention. Your district (school) can review the data to determine
whether a student is responding to the intervention. If not, then the student may be
referred for special education services.

Service Delivery for the Comprehensive Autism Program
Reviewed July 2012
Santa Clara County SELPA II’s Comprehensive Autism Program (CAP) utilizes Applied
Behavioral Analysis (ABA) framework to serve students with autism. Utilizing a range of ABA
strategies and techniques CAP focuses on new skill acquisition to replace and shape
maladaptive behaviors into appropriate social skills and learning behaviors.
Our main goal is to provide each child with autism the necessary supports to receive
educational benefit.
ABA principles guide instruction so that all students are systematically taught using: a high rate
of reinforcement, a break-down of complex skills into small teachable tasks, multiple
opportunities for practice and feedback, a hierarchy of prompts faded quickly and a highly
individualized supervised program.
CAP services change to meet the evolving developmental needs of children with autism. In the
early intervention years, teaching concentrates on imitation, communication, and attention. As
children age into their primary years, the focus shifts to developing play and appropriate social
interactions.
The continuum of services includes from least restrictive to most restrictive include:
CONSULTATIVE SERVICES
Indirect services include consultation between teacher/staff and CAP supervisor, staff training,
and/or parent training. CAP supervisors can assist in the design and implementation of student
specific behavior support plans. CAP supervisors can also support classroom staff with
recommended environmental modifications to support the student.
SMALL GROUP SERVICES
Small group behavior intervention services are comprised of 2 or more students working with a
tutor utilizing behavior analysis principles to teach skills and reduce behaviors that are
interfering with learning.
INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR INTERVENTION SERVICES
Individual behavior intervention services consist of one tutor working with one student to teach
new skills and reduce behavior problems.
The Comprehensive Autism Program consists of highly educated and trained individuals
including Manager/Director, Supervisors, Lead Tutor, and Tutors.
Each team member receives ongoing supervision and training in evidence-based practices in
autism including: ABA methodology, naturalistic and incidental teaching, social skills
facilitation, communication and language interventions, structuring the environment,
generalization and maintenance of skills, and meaningful data collection.

2. SCHEDULING
Schedules will be made by the CAP supervisors per the annual district calendars for
student days. The goal of the scheduling is to provide all students with the number of
hours as written in their IEP. Due to the intensity of CAP services and the complexity
of the scheduling situation, CAP supervisors can not accommodate individual student
schedules or requests for specific programming times (with exception to their district
classroom placement). Tutors are available to work with your student during
normal working hours (8:00am-5:00pm). In the event that the student is not
available during these times (with the exception of being in school) then these
hours cannot be counted as makeup hours.
Supervisors may modify the student’s schedule throughout the year. Prior notice will
be given to the parents.
Parents and tutors may not request to work with certain students/tutors. Schedules are
made solely on the basis of student and tutor availability in order to maximize all
hours.
All sessions are expected to start and end on time. For in-home programs, the tutors
will only wait outside for 10 minutes before they will leave. This session will be
considered cancelled by the parent and not made up.

EXTENDED SCHOOL
YEAR (ESY)
Extended school year services are individualized extensions of special education
and related services that are provided to a student with a disability beyond the
regular school year, for example, during the school (year round) and summer
vacation. They are provided by the District at no cost to the parents so that
students may maintain the specific skills they’ve learned during the school year.
ESY services vary in intensity, location, type of service and length of time,
depending upon each student’s needs.
Not every student with a disability is entitled to receive ESY services. Rather,
students who are determined by their IEP team to need ESY services are entitled
to receive them as part of a free appropriate public education. Decisions about
ESY eligibility are made individually through the IEP process usually at the
student’s annual IEP meeting. ESY eligibility is not limited to students with
particular types of disabilities.
Parents who disagree with the IEP team’s decision concerning eligibility for ESY
services may resolve their disagreement through the Due Process Procedures.

Extended School Year Programming
GUIDELINES
Pursuant to Section 300.309 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
extended school year services (ESY) shall be included in the IEP and provided
to the pupil if the IEP team determines, on an individual basis, the services are
necessary for the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE).
The need for Extended School Year (“ESY”) programming must be considered
and documented annually on the IEP for every student receiving special
education services. The need for ESY programming may be addressed at any IEP
meeting. The IEP meeting addressing ESY should take place a reasonable time
prior to the commencement of the extended break.
Determination of ESY Eligibility and Programming
ESY programming must be provided to eligible students at no additional cost to
parents. The IEP team shall determine the need for ESY eligibility and
programming considering the following factors:
Nature and severity of the disability The more severe the disability, the higher
the probability that the student will need ESY services.
Current IEP goals and objectives If progress on meeting these goals has been
very slow; the student may need ESY services to continue to make progress in
support of FAPE.
Emerging skills and breakthrough opportunities If a student is just beginning
to communicate or accomplish self-care skills a temporary break may cause a
setback.
Interfering behaviors Behavior may have an impact of student’s ability to make
educational progress.
To prevent serious regression during an extended break The Worksheet for
Determining Extended School Year Programming may be used along with the
regression/recoupment data collection sheet. If the student has continued to
progress educationally from year to year despite the lack of ESY programming,
ESY may not be necessary to ensure FAPE. Additionally however, there does not

15.10
Reviewed July 2012
need to be a pattern of regression previously but team needs to consider whether
there is a likelihood of regression based on knowledge of student.
Rare and unusual circumstances ESY services are more likely to be necessary for
students who have been absent for extended periods of time or for students
moving from restrictive placements to inclusive programs If ESY programming
is recommended, then the IEP team shall a) identify the specific goals that are to
be addressed, and b) include the specific nature of the program and services on
the IEP, including the, frequency, duration and location.
Definition: Regression/Recoupment
All students experience some regression and loss over an extended break. In
most instances these skills are re-mastered (recouped) within a reasonably short
period of time. However, some special needs students have disabilities which are
likely to continue indefinitely or for a prolonged period, and interruption of the
student’s educational programming may cause regression, when coupled with
limited recoupment capacity, rendering it impossible or unlikely that the pupil
will attain the level of self sufficiency and independence that would otherwise be
expected in view of his or her disabling condition. However, the lack of clear
evidence of such factors may not be used to deny a student an ESY program if
the team determines the need for ESY programming. Thus, when a student
experiences more than minimal regression and he/she is not able to recoup skills
within a short period of time the provision of a free appropriate public education
means that instruction and/or related services must also be provided during an
extended break.
Definition: Extended Break
Extended break means a period of time when school is not in session such as
summer break, school holidays and when school is off-track or on intersession.
Definition: Extended School Year Programming
ESY services are special education and related services that are tailored to each
student to help him or her meet specific goals in his/her IEP to support the
delivery of FAPE for the individual student as appropriate.

Resolution Session
Pursuant to Proposed USDOE Regulations for IDEA 2004
Within 15 days of receiving notice of parents’ due process complaint, and prior to
initiation of a due process hearing, the LEA must convene a Resolution Session with
the parent and the relevant member or members of the IEP Team who have specific
knowledge of the facts identified in the due process complaint. The LEA may not
include an attorney of the LEA unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney.
The purpose of the meeting is for the parents of the child to discuss their due process
complaint, and the facts that form the basis of the due process complaint, so that the
LEA has the opportunity to resolve the dispute that is the basis for the complaint.
The Resolution Meeting need not be held if the parents and the LEA agree in writing
to waive the meeting, or the parents and the LEA agree to use the State mediation
process.
If a resolution to the dispute is reached in the Resolution Meeting, the parties execute a
legally binding agreement that is signed by both parties and a representative of the
LEA that has authority to the bind the LEA. This agreement is enforceable in any State
court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.
There is an agreement review period of 3 business days. Either party may void the
agreement within 3 business days of the agreement’s execution.

Recommended Process for Resolution Sessions
The Resolution Session should be a structured meeting controlled by a designated
facilitator with the primary goal of clarifying issue(s), determining if solution(s) can be
achieved, and designating the issue(s) for hearing if no agreement to solution(s) can be
achieved.
It is recommended that LEAs use a neutral facilitator to lead the resolution session.
This could be an administrator or program specialist from another LEA. The
facilitator should be specifically trained in conducting this type of meeting and should
not have prior involvement in the case. The neutral facilitator need not see or review
information about the case except to review the Parent letter requesting a hearing or
complaint process and the district’s written response. Specific timelines are noted in
the law and require prompt response. See the following section on timelines.
Every effort should be made by the facilitator to support the parties in improving their
relationship and identifying better ways to communicate and resolve issues that may
arise in the future. However, where parties are clearly committed to specific positions,
the responsibility for resolution is with the due process complaint process.
The LEA is responsible for the implementation of any agreement and/or
hearing/complaint activity.
Purpose of Resolution Session
• Articulate and Clarify Issues
• Explore the LEA response
• Identify Options for Resolution
• Where agreement is reached, write a settlement agreement
• Develop an Action Plan and assign responsibility
• Communicate the outcome to Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH)

Writing Agreements
A written settlement agreement signed by both parties becomes a binding contract.
After the three (3) business day review period for either party to rescind the
agreement, it becomes binding on both parties.
The agreement belongs to the parties and should reflect wording that the parties
clearly understand and represent their interests in accepting the agreement. If a
facilitator is used during this session, the facilitator should support the writing of the
agreement to ensure that both parties understand the components of the agreement. It
is important that the parties review both the substantive components of the agreement
those that are technically required, and agree to the language.
Districts are encouraged to use the Settlement and Release Agreement Template. Use only
the sections that apply to the issues that are in dispute. For example, language
addressing “Assessment” should be deleted if assessment is not at issue during the
complaint or resolution process.

LETTER TO PROPOSE RESOLUTION SESSION
Dear
On [insert] the [insert] School District received a copy of your complaint requesting a
due process hearing regarding student name.
When a parent initiates a complaint for a due process hearing, a district must schedule
a preliminary resolution meeting within 15 days of receipt of the complaint, per 20
U.S.C. 1415. The purpose of the meeting is to give a parent an opportunity to discuss
the due process complaint and the facts on which the complaint is based with the
district; and to give the district an opportunity to resolve issues early in the process.
At the resolution conference, a district must have a representative present with
authority to resolve the complaint. Further, at this meeting, the district cannot have
legal counsel present, unless the parent decides to bring legal counsel. If an agreement
is reached at the resolution conference, the parent and/or the district will have 3
business days to void the agreement. If an agreement is not reached within 30 days,
the due process hearing may proceed and the applicable timelines will begin. A
district and a parent may also agree to waive this conference. This meeting is NOT an
IEP meeting.
We have scheduled a resolution conference for [insert] at the District Special
Education Office. Please confirm your attendance or your intention to waive this

Special Circumstance Instructional Assistance
(SCIA)
Introduction
By law, special education and related services to students with disabilities must be provided in the
“least restrictive environment.” When an IEP Team is considering special circumstance instructional
assistance support for a student, all aspects of the student’s program must be considered, with the
intent of maximizing student independence. The IEP Team is responsible for the design of the student’s
program and designating personnel to implement the program. The classified staff person(s)
providing the additional instructional assistance will work under the direction of certificated staff. IEP
Teams need to do a careful analysis to ensure that the IEP offers a free appropriate public education
(FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE) when addressing the need for a SCIA.
First and foremost, the goal for any student with a disability is to encourage, promote, and maximize
independence; therefore, other options should be considered before assigning a SCIA to a student.
If not carefully monitored, special circumstance assistance can easily and unintentionally foster dependence.
A student’s total educational program must be carefully evaluated to determine where
support is indicated. Natural support and existing staff support should be used whenever possible to
promote the least restrictive environment.
CHAPTER 15
15.12
Santa Clara County SELPAs
Guidelines for Related Services of
Special Circumstance Instructional Assistance
(SCIA)
A. The general categories to be considered for special circumstance instructional assistance are:
1. Behavioral
When determining that there is a need for additional personnel support due to behavioral difficulties,
the IEP must include either a Behavior Support Plan (BSP) or Behavior Intervention Plan
(BIP) and appropriate goals and objectives.
2. Instructional
When determining that there is a need for additional personnel support due to an instructional
need in special education setting, the IEP Team must utilize appropriate assessment information
to support this recommendation.
3. Inclusion/Mainstreaming
When determining that there is a need for additional personnel support to facilitate student
success in the general education environment, the IEP Team must utilize appropriate assessment
information to support this recommendation
4. Specialized Physical Health Care (SPHC)
When determining that there is a need for additional personnel support due to medical need, a
specialized physical health care plan will be developed and approved by physician and parent.
B. Pre-referral Considerations:
Prior to submitting a request for SCIA, the following issues should be addressed and considered:
1. Review how existing staff is being utilized and provide additional training in efficient use of classroom
personnel if necessary.
2. Review class loading and grouping of students within classes.
3. Review behavior support plan or behavior intervention plan for effectiveness and implementation
and modify if necessary.
4. Review supports/modifications/accommodations required for student success in regular education
or special education setting and modify if necessary.
C. Guidelines for Obtaining Special Circumstance Instructional Assistance (Behavioral, Instruction,
Inclusion)
For inter-district transfers and COE placements, when a SCIA is being considered for a student, a district
representative shall be required to participate in the IEP Team meeting.
1. Provider of service shall send district of residence the following forms: Referral for Need of Special
Circumstance Instructional Assistance (SCIA) along with the completed Student Needs for
Additional Support Rubric and Observational Evaluation to Determine the Need for Additional
Support.
2. District of residence shall have the opportunity to observe the student prior to the IEP Team
meeting.
CHAPTER 15
15.12
3. Provider of service will confer with the district of residence after they both have had the opportunity
to observe to determine if there is a need for additional data prior to the IEP Team meeting.
4. If the IEP Team determines the need for a SCIA it will be documented on the IEP and the IEP
will be reviewed at least every six (6) months. The plan should be monitored and documented
with data collection.
D. Determining the Need for Special Circumstance Instructional Assistance (SCIA)
After completing the Observational Evaluation to Determine the Need for Additional Support and the Student
Needs for Additional Support Rubric and Observational Evaluation to Determine the Need for Additional
Support an IEP Team meeting will be scheduled. The IEP should include the following:
Behavior Inclusion Instruction SPHC

Special Education Transportation Guidelines
Guidelines for use by Individualized Education Program (IEP) Teams when determining required
transportation services.
California Education Code (EC) citations, including Code content, and Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) citations have been updated to reflect changes since June 2017.
Preface
EC Section 41851.2 (Assembly Bill 876 [Canella], Chapter 283, Statutes of 1991), required the State
Superintendent of Public Instruction (SSPI) to develop special education transportation guidelines for
use by individualized education program (IEP) teams that clarify when special education services are
required.
The State Board of Education, Advisory Commission on Special Education, Special Education Local
Plan Area (SELPA) Administrators, Special Education Administrators of County Offices (SEACO),
Protection & Advocacy, Inc., Team of Advocates for Special Kids (TASK), school districts, County
Offices of Education (COE), transportation offices, California Department of Education staff and other
interested parties provided valuable contributions to the development of the 1993 Guidelines For Use
By Individualized Education Program (IEP) Teams When Determining Required Transportation
Services.
The guidelines should be utilized to plan and implement transportation services to pupils that require
this service to benefit from special education instruction and/or related services.
Introduction
EC Section 56040 states: "Every individual with exceptional needs who is eligible to receive special
education instruction and related services under this part [ Part 30 ] shall receive that instruction and
those services at no cost to his or her parents or, as appropriate, to him or her." Special education
transportation is defined in federal regulation [34 CFR Section 300.34(c)(16 )] as a related service.
Transportation is required to be provided as a related service if it is required to assist a child with a
disability to benefit from special education. In addition, as required for any special education program,
the service must be provided to meet the criteria for a free, appropriate public education as defined in
federal regulation 34 CFR Section 300.17.
EC Section 41851.2 [(Assembly Bill (AB) 876 (Canella)], Chapter 283, Statutes of 1991), required that
the SSPI develop special education transportation guidelines for use by IEP teams that clarify "when
special education transportation services, as defined in [EC] Section 41850, are required." EC
41850(d) defines "special education transportation" as:
(1) The transportation of severely disabled special day class pupils, and orthopedically impaired
pupils who require a vehicle with a wheelchair lift, who received transportation in the prior fiscal
year, as specified in their individualized education program.
(2) A vehicle that was used to transport special education pupils.
CHAPTER 15
15.13
EC 41850(b) defines "home-to-school transportation services" for pupils with exceptional needs as:
(5) The transportation of individuals with exceptional needs as specified in their individualized
education programs, who do not receive special education transportation as defined in
subdivision (d).
Examples that IEP teams may consider under EC 41850(b) include pupils with severe disabilities who
are not placed in special day classes or otherwise enrolled in programs serving pupils with profound
disabilities, pupils with orthopedic disabilities who do not use wheelchairs or require lifts, students
beginning special education who did not receive transportation under an IEP in the prior fiscal year,
pupils with other health impairments, learning disabilities or other cognitive disabilities, or pupils who
live beyond reasonable distance to their school and would not, without transportation, have access to
appropriate special education instruction and related services at no cost.
Considerations for Use by Local Education Agencies, Special Education Local Plan
Areas, County Offices of Education and/or Transportation Cooperatives
It is recommended that these issues and concepts be taken under consideration by all LEAs, SELPAs,
COEs and/or transportation cooperatives that provide any special education transportation in
preparation for organizing a transportation system and providing services that will allow for students'
placement in the least restrictive environment while also allowing for the most cost-effective special
education transportation system.
Transportation Policies
Each LEA providing special education is required to adopt policies for the programs and services it
operates, consistent with agreements with other districts or county offices and/or agreements stated as
part of the local plan for special education (EC 56195.8). These policies describe how special education
transportation is coordinated with regular home-to-school transportation and set forth criteria for
meeting the transportation needs of pupils receiving special education [ EC 56195.8(b)(5)]. It is
recommended these policies focus upon pupil needs as the primary consideration for determining
transportation services and that these policies also address the needs of pupils who may be eligible for
transportation services as required by the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504.
Delivery of Services
Districts/SELPAs/COEs responsible for implementation of IEPs should be knowledgeable of
transportation policies and/or procedures that address the responsibilities of the IEP team in regard to
transportation and the delivery of services to eligible students in their least restrictive environment.
This includes consideration of services that are provided in the setting appropriate to the needs of the
student at the pupil's neighborhood school, or within the district or SELPA; regional and/or magnet
programs and services may also be appropriate to the needs of the pupil. Consideration should be
taken regarding the effect that the location of a placement will have on the length of time that a student
has to or from school each day. Placements should not be made solely on a "space available" basis. If
a student is receiving services outside of his/her residence area, the placement should be reviewed at
least annually in order to determine if a placement closer to the student's residence would be
appropriate.
CHAPTER 15
15.13
Location of Programs, Placement of Pupils
The efficiency of a transportation system for special education is partially dependent on the location of
the program sites and the placements of students. A demographic and geographic review that analyzes
the present locations of programs, program needs, and population served should take place. Program
service regions with clearly defined service areas can then be established, using residence areas of the
neighborhood schools. While this also involves the issue of available facilities, a mission statement and
policies developed by the agency may promote the comprehensive commitment to all pupils and the
acceptance of pupils with exceptional needs in a broad variety of settings.
Additional Policy Considerations
Other subjects that need policy and procedure directives may include control of pupil medicine
transported between home and school on a vehicle; student suspension; physical intervention and
management; authority to use special harnesses, vest, and belts; early closing of school due to
inclement weather or other emergencies; authority to operate special equipment; when no adult is
home to receive pupils; when and how to involve community emergency medical and/or law
enforcement personnel; use of mobility aides; control and management of confidential information; use
of bus aides; and other.
Coordination of Calendars and Schedules
Coordination of student attendance calendars at all school sites that provide special education services
is necessary to fully utilize transportation services and to minimize the number of required days of
transportation service.
In unified districts, multi-track districts, multi-district SELPAs, COEs and/or in transportation
cooperatives, standardization of calendars should include the coordination of starting and ending dates
of school years, bell schedules (starting and ending times), vacation/intersession breaks, staff
development days (School Improvement Program, School Based Coordinated Program, other),
minimum day schedules, etc. This coordination should be done so that all significant transportation
implications are addressed and transportation resources are effectively utilized.
Length of School Day, Related Services, Extracurricular Events
It should be noted that the use of alternative starting times for all special education students at a site
can lead to program compliance concerns. Pupils receiving special education and related services must
be provided with an educational program in accordance with their IEP for at least the same length of
time as the regular school day for their chronological peer group, unless otherwise stated in a student's
IEP. In addition, there may be occasions where the needs of the pupil require receiving therapy or
some other related service that cannot be provided during the "established" school day. If provisions for
"early" or "late" transportation are made for pupils within the general education program due to extracurricular
events, provisions for equal opportunity to these events for pupils with exceptional needs who
require special transportation must also be made.
Use of Policy and Resource Information
An overview of all available transportation resources should be provided to all administrators, IEP team
leaders/case managers or chairpersons and other IEP team members who are authorized to
recommend the type of special education service and the location where the service will be provided.
CHAPTER 15
15.13
Guidelines for Use by the Individualized Education Program (IEP) Team
Local Education Agency Rules and Policies
All pupils, including those receiving specialized instruction and services, are subject to the rules and
policies governing regular transportation offerings within the local education agency, unless the specific
needs of the eligible pupil or the location of the special education program/service dictate that special
education transportation is required.
Primary Consideration: Pupil Needs
The specific needs of the pupil must be the primary consideration when an IEP team is determining any
transportation needs. These may include, but are not limited to:
1. Medical diagnosis and health needs consideration of whether long bus rides could affect a certain
pupil's health (duration, temperature control, need for services, health emergencies); general
ability and/or strength to ambulate/wheel; approximate distance from school or the distance
needed to walk or wheel oneself to the school; consideration of pupil needs in inclement or very
hot weather, other.
2. Physical accessibility of curbs, sidewalks, streets, and public transportation systems.
3. Consideration of a pupil's capacity to arrive at school on time, to avoid getting lost, to avoid
dangerous traffic situations, and to avoid other potentially dangerous or exploitative situations on
the way to and from school.
4. Behavioral Intervention Plans [Education Code sections 56520-56525] specified by the pupil's IEP
and consideration of how to implement such plans while a pupil is being transported.
5. Mid-day or other transportation needs as required on a pupil's IEP (for example, occupational or
physical therapy or mental health services at another site, community based classes, etc.) must
also be taken into consideration when the IEP team discusses a pupil's placement and
transportation needs.
6. Extended school year services, pursuant to EC Section 56345(b)(3), should be another
consideration of a pupil’s need for transportation if considered necessary to provide a free
appropriate public education as specified in a pupil’s IEP.
Transportation Staff and IEP Team Meetings
Effective practice requires that procedures are developed for communication with transportation
personnel and that transportation staff are present at IEP team meetings when the pupil needs the use
of adaptive or assistive equipment, when school bus equipment is required to be modified, when the
pupil exhibits severe behavioral difficulties and a behavior intervention plan is to be implemented, when
the pupil is medically fragile and requires special assistance, and/or when the pupil has other unique
needs.
Transportation Options
Considering the identified needs of the pupil, transportation options may include, but not be limited to:
walking, riding the regular school bus, utilizing available public transportation (any out-of-pocket costs
to the pupil or parents are reimbursed by the local education agency), riding a special bus from a pick
up point, and portal-to-portal special education transportation via a school bus, taxi, reimbursed
parent's driving with a parent's voluntary participation, or other mode as determined by the IEP team.
When developing specific IEP goals and objectives related to the pupil's use of public transportation,
the IEP team may wish to consider a blend of transportation services as the pupil's needs evolve.
Specialized transportation, as a related service, must be written on the pupil's IEP with specificity and
should be approved by the transportation administrator. It is recommended that services be described
CHAPTER 15
15.13
in sufficient enough detail to inform the parties of how, when and from where to where transportation
will be provided and, where arrangements for the reimbursement of parents are required, the amount
and frequency of reimbursement.
Suspension from the School Bus
Occasionally pupils receiving special education services are suspended from bus transportation (EC
48900-48927 Suspension or Expulsion). The suspension of a pupil receiving special education services
from California transportation can constitute a significant change of placement if the district: 1) has
been transporting the student; 2) suspends the student from transportation as a disciplinary measure;
and 3) does not provide another mode of transportation (Office of Civil Rights, Letter of Finding
Complaint No. 04-89-1236, December 8, 1989).
A significant change in placement requires a meeting of the IEP team to review the pupil's IEP. During
the period of any exclusion from bus transportation, pupils must be provided with an alternative form of
transportation at no cost to the pupil or parent or guardian in order to be assured of having access to
the required special education instruction and services (EC 48915.5).
EC 48915.5(c) reads:
If an individual with exceptional needs is excluded from school bus transportation, the pupil is
entitled to be provided with an alternative form of transportation at no cost to the pupil or parent
or guardian provided that transportation is specified in the pupil's individualized education
program. (AB 1859, Chapter 492, Statutes of 2002 as amended by AB 685, Chapter 56,
Statutes of 2007.)
Summary
The LEA providing special education is required to adopt policies for the programs and services it
operates, consistent with agreements with other districts or county offices stated as part of the local
plan for special education. These policies describe how special education transportation is coordinated
with regular home-to-school transportation and set forth criteria that are consistent with these
Guidelines for meeting the transportation needs of pupils receiving special education.
These policies and an overview of all available transportation resources should be provided to all
administrators, IEP team leaders/case managers/chairpersons and other IEP team members who are
authorized to recommend the type of special education service and the location where the service will
be provided.
The specific needs of the pupil must be the primary consideration when an IEP team is determining
transportation services. It is often beneficial to have transportation staff present at IEP team meetings.
The combination of planning and providing information to IEP teams maximizes appropriate placements
and efficient cost-effective transportation systems.
Notice
The guidance in the Special Education Transportation Guidelines is not binding on local education
agencies (LEAs) or other entities. Except for the statutes, regulations, and court decisions that are
referenced herein, the Guidelines are exemplary and compliance is not mandatory. (EC Section
33308.5)

CMA Participation Criteria and Definition of Terms
California Modified Assessment
Participation Criteria
These criteria for guiding individualized education program (IEP) teams in making decisions
about which students with disabilities should participate in the California Modified Assessment
(CMA) are based, in part, on Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 200—Title I—
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged.
1. Previous Participation
CST
The student shall have taken the California Standards Test (CST) in a previous year and
scored Below Basic or Far Below Basic in the subject area being assessed by the CMA and
may have taken the CST with modifications.
CAPA
Previous participation in the California Alternate Performance Assessment (CAPA) shall
not preclude a student from participation in the CMA.
The student shall have taken the CAPA Level 2–5 in two previous years and received a
performance level of either Proficient or Advanced
Note: The student shall not be allowed to take both the CAPA and CMA. Students shall take
either:
– CAPA in all subject areas;
– CST in all subject areas;
– CMA in all subject areas; or
– a combination of CST and CMA in the subject areas being assessed.
2. Progress Based On Multiple Measures and Objective Evidence
The student’s disability has precluded the student from achieving grade-level
proficiency, as demonstrated by such objective evidence as the student’s performance on
the CST and other assessments that can validly document academic achievement within
Under Review
CHAPTER 15
15.14.3
the year covered by the student’s IEP plan. The determination of the student’s progress
must be based on multiple measurements, over a period of time that are valid for the
subjects being assessed.
The student will not receive a proficient score on the CST (even with provision of
accommodations) based on evidence from multiple, valid, and objective measures of
student progress (or lack of progress)
3. Response To Appropriate Instruction
The student’s progress to date in response to appropriate grade- level instruction,
including special education and related services designed to address the student’s
individual needs, is such that, even if significant growth occurs, the IEP team is
reasonably certain that the student will not achieve grade-level proficiency within the
year covered by the student’s IEP plan.
The student who is assessed with the CMA has access to the curriculum, including
instruction and materials for the grade in which the student is enrolled
The student’s IEP plan includes grade-level California content standards-based goals
and support in the classroom for a subject or subjects assessed by the CMA.
The student has received special education and related services to support access to and
progress in the general curriculum in which the student is enrolled
The IEP team has determined that the student will not achieve grade-level proficiency
even with instructional intervention
4. High School Diploma
The student who takes alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement
standards is not precluded from attempting to complete requirements, as defined by the
State, for a regular high school diploma.
Note: Students must continue to meet the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE)
requirement in order to receive a diploma from a California public high school.
5. Parents Are Informed
Parents of the students selected to be assessed with the CMA are informed that their
child’s achievement will be measured based on modified achievement standards.
Note: The test, while based on grade level content, is less rigorous than the CST.
Under Review
CHAPTER 15
15.14.3
California Modified Assessment Additional Decision Making Considerations for CMA
1. The decision to participate in the CMA is not based on the amount of time the
student is receiving special education services.
2. The decision to participate in the CMA is not based on excessive or extended
absences.
3. The decision to participate in the CMA is not based on language, culture, or
economic differences.
4. The decision to participate in the CMA is not based solely on the student’s disability
(i.e., deafness/blindness, visual, auditory and or motor disabilities) but rather the
student’s inability to appropriately demonstrate his or her knowledge on the
California content standards through the CST.
5. The decision to use the CMA is an IEP team decision based on student needs.
California Modified Assessment
Definition of Terms
CAPA is designed to assess those students with significant cognitive disabilities who cannot
participate in the CST or the CMA even with accommodations and/or modifications. The CDE
developed CAPA to comply with the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
CAPA links directly to the California academic content standards at each grade level and
accurately reflects the portions of the content standards from Kindergarten through high school
that are accessible to students with significant cognitive disabilities. CAPA is given in grade
spans (Levels I – V).
CMA is designed to assess those students whose disabilities preclude them from achieving
grade-level proficiency on an assessment of the California content standards with or without
accommodations. The CMA has been developed to provide more access so students can better
demonstrate their knowledge of the California content standards. The CDE developed CMA to
comply with the flexibility offered through the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act of
2001.
CST in English-language arts, mathematics, science, and history-social science are administered
only to students in California public schools. Except for a writing component that is
administered as part of the grade four and seven English-language arts tests, all questions are
multiple-choice. These tests were developed specifically to assess students' knowledge of the
California content standards.
California content standards were adopted by the State Board of Education and specify what
all California children are expected to know and be able to do in each grade or course.
Goals are those written by the IEP team, while not inclusive, for reading, writing, and
mathematics and may include support for those areas in additional courses or study.
Under Review
CHAPTER 15
15.14.3
Grade-level proficiency refers to the student’s level of knowledge and degree of mastery of the
California Content Standards for the subjects being assessed. This grade-level proficiency
should not be confused with the CAASPP Performance Levels as reported on the CAASPP
student report.
Objective evidence is the most recent data available for the student’s performance on the
California Standards Test (CST), CAPA, or CMA and locally used assessments and/or
assignments, whether used for placement, diagnosis or to track student progress throughout the
year.
Modified academic achievement standards are used to measure the students’ achievement on
the California Modified Assessment; are aligned to the California content standards, but less
difficult than the grade-level academic achievement standards; and are developed through a
validated standard setting process.
Multiple Measures are various assessments and/or instruments, including CAASPP program
assessments, as well as locally used assessments and/or assignments, whether used for
placement, diagnosis or to track student progress throughout the year.
Valid refers to the degree to which evidence and theory support the intended purpose of the
test and the interpretation of test scores for the subjects being assessed.

CAPA PARTICIPATION CRITERIA
California Alternate Performance Assessment (CAPA) Participation Criteria assists
Individualized Education Program teams in determining how a student should participate in
the Standardized Testing & Reporting (STAR) Program.
Test site coordinators are responsible for having students’ Individualized Education Plans
(IEPs) reviewed to determine if the students will take the California Standards Tests (CSTs)
with no accommodations or modifications, take the CSTs with accommodations and/or
modifications, take the California Modified Assessment (CMA), or take the CAPA. Since
examiners may adapt the CAPA based on students’ instruction mode, accommodations and
modifications do not apply to CAPA.
IEP teams determine how students with disabilities will participate in the STAR Program. If the
IEP team determines that the student should be assessed with the CAPA, the IEP team is also
responsible for determining if the student should take the grade-assigned CAPA level or CAPA
Level I. This information is included on each student’s IEP. Students with grade-level
designations on their IEPs must take either CAPA Level I or the CAPA level designated for
their individual grade level.

California Alternate Performance Assessment Participation
Criteria
Eligibility for CAPA is based on a student’s individualized education program (IEP) that
reflects an emphasis on curricular instruction of the California contents standards based on
alternate achievement standards. In order to aid an IEP team in its determination of whether a
student should be assessed by the CAPA, the following shall be considered:
Circle “Agree” or “Disagree” for each task:
Agree Disagree
The student demonstrates academic/cognitive ability and adaptive
behavior that require substantial adjustments to the general
curriculum. The student may participate in many of the same
activities as his or her nondisabled peers; however, his or her learning
objectives and expected outcomes focus on the functional
applications of the general curriculum.
Agree Disagree
The student cannot address the performance level assessed in the
statewide assessment, even with accommodations or modifications.
Agree Disagree
The decision to participate in the alternate assessment is not based on
the amount of time the student is receiving special education services.
Agree Disagree The decision to participate in the alternate assessment is not based on
excessive or extended absences.
Agree Disagree
The decision to participate in the alternate assessment is not based on
language, cultural, or economic differences.
Agree Disagree
The decision to participate in the alternate assessment is not based on
deafness/blindness, visual, auditory, and/or motor disabilities.
Agree Disagree
The decision to participate in the alternate assessment is not primarily
based on a specific categorical label.
Agree Disagree
The decision for alternate assessment is an IEP team decision, rather
than an administrative decision.
If the answer to any of these questions is “Disagree,” the team should consider
including the student in either the California Standards Tests (with the use of
any necessary accommodations or modifications) or the California Modified
Assessment (grades 3–5 only).

Special Education Rights of Parents and Children
Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B, and the
California Education Code
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
Revised October 2016
Note: The term school district is used throughout this document to describe any public
education agency responsible for providing your child’s special education program. The term
assessment is used to mean evaluation or testing. Federal and state laws are cited throughout
this notice using English abbreviations, which are explained in a glossary on the last page of
this notification.
What is the Notice of Procedural Safeguards?
This information provides you as parents, legal guardians, and surrogate parents of children
with disabilities from three (3) years of age through age twenty-one (21) and students who have
reached age eighteen (18), the age of majority, with an overview of your educational rights or
procedural safeguards.
The Notice of Procedural Safeguards is required under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (in English, referred to as IDEA) and must be provided to you:
• When you ask for a copy
• The first time your child is referred for a special education assessment
• Each time you are given an assessment plan to evaluate your child
• Upon receipt of the first state or due process complaint in a school year, and
• When the decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a change of placement
(20 USC 1415[d]; 34 CFR 300.504; EC 56301[d] [2], EC 56321, and 56341.1[g] [1])
What is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)?
IDEA is a federal law that requires school districts to provide a “free appropriate public
education” (in English, referred to as FAPE) to eligible children with disabilities. A free
appropriate public education means that special education and related services are to be
provided as described in an individualized education program (in English, known as IEP) and
under public supervision to your child at no cost to you.
May I participate in decisions about my child’s education?
You must be given opportunities to participate in any decision-making meeting regarding your
child’s special education program. You have the right to participate in IEP team meetings about
the identification (eligibility), assessment, or educational placement of your child and other
matters relating to your child’s FAPE. (20 USC 1414[d] [1]B–[d][1][D]; 34 CFR 300.321; EC
56341[b], 56343[c])
The parent or guardian, or the local educational agency (LEA), has the right to participate in the
development of the IEP and to initiate their intent to electronically audiotape the proceedings of
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 2 of 14
the IEP team meetings. At least 24 hours prior to the meeting, the parent or guardian shall notify
the members of the IEP team of their intent to record a meeting. If the parent or guardian does
not consent to the LEA audiotape recording an IEP meeting, the meeting shall not be recorded
on an audiotape recorder.
Your rights include information about the availability of FAPE, including all program options, and
all available alternative programs, both public and nonpublic. (20 USC 1401[3], 1412[a][3]; 34
CFR 300.111; EC 56301, 56341.1[g][1], and 56506)
Where can I get more help?
When you have a concern about your child’s education, it is important that you contact your
child’s teacher or administrator to talk about your child and any problems you see. Staff in your
school district or special education local plan area (SELPA) may answer questions about your
child’s education, your rights, and procedural safeguards. Also, when you have a concern, this
informal conversation often solves the problem and helps to maintain open communication.
You may also want to contact one of the California parent organizations (Family Empowerment
Centers and Parent Training Institutes), which were developed to increase collaboration
between parents and educators to improve the educational system. Contact information for
these organizations is found on the CDE special education California Parent Organizations Web
page at http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/qa/caprntorg.asp.
Additional resources are listed at the end of this document to help you understand the
procedural safeguards.
What if my child is deaf, hard of hearing, blind, visually impaired, or deaf-blind?
The State Special Schools provide services to students who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind,
visually impaired, or deaf-blind at each of its three facilities: the California Schools for the Deaf
in Fremont and Riverside and at the California School for the Blind in Fremont. Residential and
day school programs are offered to students from infancy to age 21 at both State Schools for
the Deaf. Such programs are offered to students aged five through 21 at the California School
for the Blind. The State Special Schools also offer assessment services and technical
assistance. For more information about the State Special Schools, please visit the California
Department of Education (CDE) Web site at http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ss/ or ask for more
information from the members of your child’s IEP team.

You have the right to refer your child for special education services. You must give informed,
written consent before your child’s first special education assessment can proceed. The parent
has at least fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the proposed assessment plan to arrive at a
decision. The assessment may begin immediately upon receipt of the consent and must be
completed and an IEP developed within sixty (60) days of your consent.
When is my approval required for services?
You must give informed, written consent before your school district can provide your child with
special education and related services.
What are the procedures when a parent does not provide consent?
If you do not provide consent for an initial assessment or fail to respond to a request to provide
the consent, the school district may pursue the initial assessment by utilizing due process
procedures.
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 4 of 14
If you refuse to consent to the initiation of services, the school district must not provide special
education and related services and shall not seek to provide services through due process
procedures.
If you consent in writing to the special education and related services for your child but do not
consent to all of the components of the IEP, those components of the program to which you
have consented must be implemented without delay.
If the school district determines that the proposed special education program component to
which you do not consent is necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to your
child, a due process hearing must be initiated. If a due process hearing is held, the hearing
decision shall be final and binding.
In the case of reevaluations, the school district must document reasonable measures to obtain
your consent. If you fail to respond, the school district may proceed with the reevaluation without
your consent. (20 USC 1414[a][1][D] and 1414[c]; 34 CFR 300.300; EC 56506[e], 56321[c] and
[d], and 56346).
When may I revoke consent?
If at any time subsequent to the initial provision of special education and related services, the
parent of a child revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special education and
related services, the public agency:
1. May not continue to provide special education and related services to the child, but must
provide prior written notice in accordance with 34 CFR Section 300.503 before ceasing such
services
2. May not use the procedures in subpart E of Part 300 34 CFR (including the mediation
procedures under 34 CFR Section 300.506 or the due process procedures under 34 CFR
Sections 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services
may be provided to the child
3. Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make a free appropriate public
education (FAPE) available to the child because of the failure to provide the child with
further special education and related services
4. Is not required to convene an IEP team meeting or develop an IEP under 34 CFR Sections
300.320 and 300.324 for the child for further provision of special education and related
services
Please note, in accordance with 34 CFR Section 300.9 (c)(3), that if the parents revoke consent
in writing for their child’s receipt of special education services after the child is initially provided
special education and related services, the public agency is not required to amend the child’s
education records to remove any references to the child’s receipt of special education and
related services because of the revocation of consent.
Surrogate Parent Appointment
What if a parent cannot be identified or located?
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 5 of 14
School districts must ensure that an individual is assigned to act as a surrogate parent for the
parents of a child with a disability when a parent cannot be identified and the school district
cannot discover the whereabouts of a parent.
A surrogate parent may also be appointed if the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth, an
adjudicated dependent or ward of the court under the state Welfare and Institution Code, and is
referred to special education or already has an IEP. (20 USC 1415[b][2] ; 34 CFR 300.519; EC
56050; GC 7579.5 and 7579.6)
Nondiscriminatory Assessment
How is my child assessed for special education services?
You have the right to have your child assessed in all areas of suspected disability. Materials and
procedures used for assessment and placement must not be racially, culturally, or sexually
discriminatory.
Assessment materials must be provided and the test administered in your child’s native
language or mode of communication and in the form most likely to yield accurate information on
what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally, and functionally, unless it is
clearly not feasible to so provide or administer.
No single procedure can be the sole criterion for determining eligibility and developing FAPE for
your child. (20 USC 1414[b][1]–[3], 1412[a][6][B]; 34 CFR 300.304; EC 56001[j] and 56320)
Independent Educational Assessments
May my child be tested independently at the district’s expense?
If you disagree with the results of the assessment conducted by the school district, you have the
right to ask for and obtain an independent educational assessment for your child from a person
qualified to conduct the assessment at public expense.
The parent is entitled to only one independent educational evaluation at public expense each
time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.
The school district must respond to your request for an independent educational assessment
and provide you information about where to obtain an independent educational assessment.
If the school district believes that the district’s assessment is appropriate and disagrees that an
independent assessment is necessary, the school district must request a due process hearing
to prove that its assessment was appropriate. If the district prevails, you still have the
right to an independent assessment but not at public expense. The IEP team must consider
independent assessments.
District assessment procedures allow in-class observation of students. If the school district
observes your child in his or her classroom during an assessment, or if the school district would
have been allowed to observe your child, an individual conducting an independent educational
assessment must also be allowed to observe your child in the classroom.
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 6 of 14
If the school district proposes a new school setting for your child and an independent
educational assessment is being conducted, the independent assessor must be allowed to first
observe the proposed new setting. (20 USC 1415[b][1] and [d][2][A]; 34 CFR 300.502; EC
56329[b] and [c])

Access to Educational Records
May I examine my child’s educational records?
You have a right to inspect and review all of your child’s education records without unnecessary
delay, including prior to a meeting about your child’s IEP or before a due process hearing. The
school district must provide you access to records and copies, if requested, within five (5)
business days after the request has been made orally or in writing. (EC 49060, 56043[n],
56501[b][3], and 56504)
How Disputes Are Resolved
Due Process Hearing
When is a due process hearing available?
You have the right to request an impartial due process hearing regarding the identification,
assessment, and educational placement of your child or the provision of FAPE. The request for
a due process hearing must be filed within two years from the date you knew or should have
known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process complaint. (20 USC
1415[b][6]; 34 CFR 300.507; EC 56501 and 56505[l])
Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution
May I request mediation or an alternative way to resolve the dispute?
A request for mediation may be made either before or after a request for a due process hearing
is made.
You may ask the school district to resolve disputes through mediation or alternative dispute
resolution (ADR), which is less adversarial than a due process hearing. The ADR and mediation
are voluntary methods of resolving a dispute and may not be used to delay your right to a due
process hearing.
What is a pre-hearing mediation conference?
You may seek resolution through mediation prior to filing a request for a due process hearing.
The conference is an informal proceeding conducted in a nonadversarial manner to resolve
issues relating to the identification, assessment, or educational placement of a child or to a
FAPE.
At the prehearing mediation conference, the parent or the school district may be accompanied
and advised by nonattorney representatives and may consult with an attorney prior to or
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 8 of 14
following the conference. However, requesting or participating in a prehearing mediation
conference is not a prerequisite to requesting a due process hearing.
All requests for a prehearing mediation conference shall be filed with the Superintendent. The
party initiating a prehearing mediation conference by filing a written request with the
Superintendent shall provide the other party to the mediation with a copy of the request at the
same time the request is filed.
The prehearing mediation conference shall be scheduled within fifteen (15) days of receipt by
the Superintendent of the request for mediation and shall be completed within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the request for mediation unless both parties agree to extend the time. If a
resolution is reached, the parties shall execute a legally binding written agreement that sets
forth the resolution. All discussions during the mediation process shall be confidential. All
prehearing mediation conferences shall be scheduled in a timely manner and held at a time and
place reasonably convenient to the parties. If the issues fail to be resolved to the satisfaction of
all parties, the party who requested the mediation conference has the option of filing for a due
process hearing. (EC 56500.3 and 56503)
Due Process Rights
What are my due process rights?
You have a right to:
1. Have a fair and impartial administrative hearing at the state level before a person who is
knowledgeable of the laws governing special education and administrative hearings (20
USC 1415[f][1][A], 1415[f][3][A]-[D]; 34 CFR 300.511; EC 56501[b][4])
2. Be accompanied and advised by an attorney and/or individuals who have knowledge about
children with disabilities (EC 56505 [e][1])
3. Present evidence, written arguments, and oral arguments (EC 56505[e][2])
4. Confront, cross-examine, and require witnesses to be present
(EC 56505[e][3])
5. Receive a written or, at the option of the parent, an electronic verbatim record of the
hearing, including findings of fact and decisions (EC 56505[e][4])
6. Have your child present at the hearing (EC 56501[c][1])
7. Have the hearing be open or closed to the public (EC 56501[c][2])
8. Receive a copy of all documents, including assessments completed by that date and
recommendations, and a list of witnesses and their general area of testimony within five (5)
business days before a hearing (EC 56505[e][7] and 56043[v])
9. Be informed by the other parties of the issues and their proposed resolution of the issues at
least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing (EC 56505[e][6])
10. Have an interpreter provided (CCR 3082[d])
11. Request an extension of the hearing timeline (EC 56505[f][3])
12. Have a mediation conference at any point during the due process hearing (EC 56501[b][2]),
and
13. Receive notice from the other party at least ten days prior to the hearing that the other party
intends to be represented by an attorney (EC 56507[a]). (20 USC 1415[e]; 34 CFR 300.506,

Filing a Written Due Process Complaint
How do I request a due process hearing?
You need to file a written request for a due process hearing. You or your representative needs
to submit the following information in your request:
1. Name of the child
2. Address of the residence of the child
3. Name of the school the child is attending
4. In the case of a homeless child, available contact information for the child and the name of
the school the child is attending, and
5. A description of the nature of the problem, including facts relating to the problem(s) and a
proposed resolution of the problem(s)
Federal and state laws require that either party filing for a due process hearing must provide a
copy of the written request to the other party. (20 USC 1415[b][7], 1415[c][2]; 34 CFR 300.508;
EC 56502[c][1])
Prior to filing for a due process hearing, the school district shall be provided the opportunity to
resolve the matter by convening a resolution session, which is a meeting between the parents
and the relevant members of the IEP team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in
the due process hearing request. (20 USC 1415[f][1][B]; 34 CFR 300.510)
What does a resolution session include?
Resolution sessions shall be convened within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice of
the parents’ due process hearing request. The sessions shall include a representative of the
school district who has decision-making authority and not include an attorney of the school
district unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney. The parent of the child may discuss
the due process hearing issue and the facts that form the basis of the due process hearing
request.
The resolution session is not required if the parent and the school district agree in writing to
waive the meeting. If the school district has not resolved the due process hearing issue within
thirty (30) days, the due process hearing may occur. If a resolution is reached, the parties shall
execute a legally binding agreement. (20 USC 1415[f][1][B]; 34 CFR 300.510)
Does my child’s placement change during the proceedings?
The child involved in any administrative or judicial proceeding must remain in the current
educational placement unless you and the school district agree on another arrangement.
If you are applying for initial admission of your child to a public school, your child will be placed
in a public school program with your consent until all proceedings are completed. (20 USC
1415[j]; 34 CFR 300.518; EC 56505[d])
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 10 of 14
May the decision be appealed?
The hearing decision is final and binding on both parties. Either party may appeal the hearing
decision by filing a civil action in state or federal court within 90 days of the final decision. (20
USC 1415[i][2] and [3][A], 1415[l]; 34 CFR 300.516; EC 56505[h] and [k], EC 56043[w])
Who pays for my attorneys’ fees?
In any action or proceeding regarding the due process hearing, the court, in its discretion, may
award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to you as parent of a child with a disability
if you are the prevailing party in the hearing. Reasonable attorneys’ fees may also be made
following the conclusion of the administrative hearing, with the agreement of the parties. (20
USC 1415[i][3][B]–[G]; 34 CFR 300.517; EC 56507[b])
Fees may be reduced if any of the following conditions prevail:
1. The court finds that you unreasonably delayed the final resolution of the controversy
2. The attorneys’ hourly fees exceed the prevailing rate in the community
for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, reputation, and experience
3. The time spent and legal services provided were excessive, or
4. Your attorney did not provide to the school district the appropriate information in the due
process request notice.
Attorneys’ fees will not be reduced, however, if the court finds that the State or the school
district unreasonably delayed the final resolution of the action or proceeding or that there was a
violation of this section of law. (20 USC 1415[i][3][B]-[G]; 34 CFR 300.517)
Attorneys’ fees relating to any meeting of the IEP team may not be awarded unless an IEP team
meeting is convened as a result of a due process hearing proceeding or judicial action.
Attorneys’ fees may also be denied if you reject a reasonable settlement offer made by the
district/public agency ten (10) days before the hearing begins and the hearing decision is not
more favorable than the offer of settlement. (20 USC 1415[i][3][B]–[G]; 34 CFR 300.517)

School Discipline and Placement Procedures
for Students with Disabilities
School Discipline and Alternative Interim Educational Settings
May my child be suspended or expelled?
School personnel may consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when
determining whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability who
violates a code of student conduct from his or her setting to:
• An appropriate interim alternative education setting, another setting, or suspension for
not more than ten (10) consecutive school days, and
• Additional removals of not more than ten (10) consecutive school days in the same
school year for separate incidents of misconduct
What occurs after a removal of more than ten (10) days?
After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her current placement for ten (10)
school days in the same school year, during any subsequent days of removal the public agency
must provide services to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education
curriculum and progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child’s IEP. Also, a child will
receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention
services and modifications, which are designed to address the behavior violation so that it does
not recur.
If a child exceeds ten (10) days in such a placement, an IEP team meeting must be held to
determine whether the child’s misconduct is caused by the disability. This IEP team meeting
must take place immediately, if possible, or within ten (10) days of the school district’s decision
to take this type of disciplinary action.
As a parent you will be invited to participate as a member of this IEP team. The school district
may be required to develop an assessment plan to address the misconduct or, if your child has
a behavior intervention plan, review and modify the plan as necessary.
What happens if the IEP team determines that the misconduct is not caused by
the disability?
If the IEP team concludes that the misconduct was not a manifestation of the child’s disability,
the school district may take disciplinary action, such as expulsion, in the same manner as it
would for a child without a disability. (20 USC 1415[k][1] and [7]; 34 CFR 300.530)
If you disagree with the IEP team’s decision, you may request an expedited due process
hearing, which must occur within twenty (20) school days of the date on which you requested
the hearing. (20 USC 1415[k][2]; 34 CFR 300.531[c])
Regardless of the setting the school district must continue to provide FAPE for your child.
Alternative educational settings must allow the child to continue to participate in the general
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 12 of 14
curriculum and ensure continuation of services and modifications detailed in the IEP. (34 CFR
300.530; EC 48915.5[b])
Children Attending Private School
May students who are parentally placed in private schools participate in publicly
funded special education programs?
Children who are enrolled by their parents in private schools may participate in publicly funded
special education programs. The school district must consult with private schools and with
parents to determine the services that will be offered to private school students. Although school
districts have a clear responsibility to offer FAPE to students with disabilities, those children,
when placed by their parent in private schools, do not have the right to receive some
or all of the special education and related services necessary to provide FAPE. (20 USC
1415[a][10][A]; 34 CFR 300.137 and 300.138; EC 56173)
If a parent of an individual with exceptional needs who previously received special education
and related services under the authority of the school district enrolls the child in a private
elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the local
educational agency, the school district is not required to provide special education if the district
has made FAPE available. A court or a due process hearing officer may require the school
district to reimburse the parent or guardian for the cost of special education and the private
school only if the court or due process hearing officer finds that the school district had not made
FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment in the private elementary
school or secondary school and that the private placement is appropriate. (20 USC
1412[a][10][C]; 34 CFR 300.148; EC 56175)
When may reimbursement be reduced or denied?
The court or hearing officer may reduce or deny reimbursement if you did not make your child
available for an assessment upon notice from the school district before removing your child from
public school. You may also be denied reimbursement if you did not inform the school district
that you were rejecting the special education placement proposed by the school district,
including stating your concerns and intent to enroll your child in a private school at public
expense.
Your notice to the school district must be given either:
• At the most recent IEP team meeting you attended before removing your child from the
public school, or
• In writing to the school district at least ten (10) business days (including holidays) before
removing your child from the public school. (20 USC 1412[a][10][C]; 34 CFR 300.148;
EC 56176)
When may reimbursement not be reduced or denied?
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX A
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 13 of 14
A court or hearing officer must not reduce or deny reimbursement to you if you failed to provide
written notice to the school district for any of the following reasons:
• The school prevented you from providing notice
• You had not received a copy of this Notice of Procedural Safeguards or otherwise been
informed of the requirement to notify the district
• Providing notice would likely have resulted in physical harm to your child
• Illiteracy and inability to write in English prevented you from providing notice, or
• Providing notice would likely have resulted in serious emotional harm to your child
(20 USC 1412[a] [10] [C]; 34 CFR 300.148; EC 56177)
State Complaint Procedures
When may I file a state compliance complaint?
You may file a state compliance complaint when you believe that a school district has violated
federal or state special education laws or regulations. Your written complaint must specify at
least one alleged violation of federal and state special education laws. The violation must have
occurred not more than one year prior to the date the complaint is received by the California
Department of Education (CDE). When filing a complaint, you must forward a copy of the
complaint to the school district at the same time you file a state compliance complaint with the
CDE. (34 CFR 300.151–153; 5 CCR 4600)
Complaints alleging violations of federal and state special education laws or regulations may be
mailed to:
California Department of Education
Special Education Division

Special Education Rights of Parents and Children
Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part B, and the
California Education Code
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
Revised October 2016
Note: The term school district is used throughout this document to describe any public
education agency responsible for providing your child’s special education program. The term
assessment is used to mean evaluation or testing. Federal and state laws are cited throughout
this notice using English abbreviations, which are explained in a glossary on the last page of
this notification.
What is the Notice of Procedural Safeguards?
This information provides you as parents, legal guardians, and surrogate parents of children
with disabilities from three (3) years of age through age twenty-one (21) and students who have
reached age eighteen (18), the age of majority, with an overview of your educational rights or
procedural safeguards.
The Notice of Procedural Safeguards is required under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (in English, referred to as IDEA) and must be provided to you:
• When you ask for a copy
• The first time your child is referred for a special education assessment
• Each time you are given an assessment plan to evaluate your child
• Upon receipt of the first state or due process complaint in a school year, and
• When the decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a change of placement
(20 USC 1415[d]; 34 CFR 300.504; EC 56301[d] [2], EC 56321, and 56341.1[g] [1])
What is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)?
IDEA is a federal law that requires school districts to provide a “free appropriate public
education” (in English, referred to as FAPE) to eligible children with disabilities. A free
appropriate public education means that special education and related services are to be
provided as described in an individualized education program (in English, known as IEP) and
under public supervision to your child at no cost to you.
May I participate in decisions about my child’s education?
You must be given opportunities to participate in any decision-making meeting regarding your
child’s special education program. You have the right to participate in IEP team meetings about
the identification (eligibility), assessment, or educational placement of your child and other
matters relating to your child’s FAPE. (20 USC 1414[d] [1]B–[d][1][D]; 34 CFR 300.321; EC
56341[b], 56343[c])
The parent or guardian, or the local educational agency (LEA), has the right to participate in the
development of the IEP and to initiate their intent to electronically audiotape the proceedings of
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 2 of 14
the IEP team meetings. At least 24 hours prior to the meeting, the parent or guardian shall notify
the members of the IEP team of their intent to record a meeting. If the parent or guardian does
not consent to the LEA audiotape recording an IEP meeting, the meeting shall not be recorded
on an audiotape recorder.
Your rights include information about the availability of FAPE, including all program options, and
all available alternative programs, both public and nonpublic. (20 USC 1401[3], 1412[a][3]; 34
CFR 300.111; EC 56301, 56341.1[g][1], and 56506)
Where can I get more help?
When you have a concern about your child’s education, it is important that you contact your
child’s teacher or administrator to talk about your child and any problems you see. Staff in your
school district or special education local plan area (SELPA) may answer questions about your
child’s education, your rights, and procedural safeguards. Also, when you have a concern, this
informal conversation often solves the problem and helps to maintain open communication.
You may also want to contact one of the California parent organizations (Family Empowerment
Centers and Parent Training Institutes), which were developed to increase collaboration
between parents and educators to improve the educational system. Contact information for
these organizations is found on the CDE special education California Parent Organizations Web
page at http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/qa/caprntorg.asp.
Additional resources are listed at the end of this document to help you understand the
procedural safeguards.
What if my child is deaf, hard of hearing, blind, visually impaired, or deaf-blind?
The State Special Schools provide services to students who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind,
visually impaired, or deaf-blind at each of its three facilities: the California Schools for the Deaf
in Fremont and Riverside and at the California School for the Blind in Fremont. Residential and
day school programs are offered to students from infancy to age 21 at both State Schools for
the Deaf. Such programs are offered to students aged five through 21 at the California School
for the Blind. The State Special Schools also offer assessment services and technical
assistance. For more information about the State Special Schools, please visit the California
Department of Education (CDE) Web site at http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ss/ or ask for more
information from the members of your child’s IEP team.
Notice, Consent, Assessment, Surrogate Parent
Appointment, and Access to Records
Prior Written Notice
When is a notice needed?
This notice must be given when the school district proposes or refuses to initiate a change in the
identification, assessment, or educational placement of your child with special needs or the
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 3 of 14
provision of a free appropriate public education. (20 USC 1415[b][3] and (4), 1415[c][1],
1414[b][1]; 34 CFR 300.503; EC 56329 and 56506[a])
The school district must inform you about proposed evaluations of your child in a written notice
or an assessment plan within fifteen (15) days of your written request for evaluation. The notice
must be understandable and in your native language or other mode of communication, unless it
is clearly not feasible to do so. (34 CFR 300.304; EC 56321)
What will the notice tell me?
The Prior Written Notice must include the following:
1. A description of the actions proposed or refused by the school district
2. An explanation of why the action was proposed or refused
3. A description of each assessment procedure, record, or report the agency used as a basis
for the action proposed or refused
4. A statement that parents of a child with a disability have protection under the procedural
safeguards
5. Sources for parents to contact to obtain assistance in understanding the provisions of this
part
6. A description of other options that the IEP team considered and the reasons those options
were rejected; and
7. A description of any other factors relevant to the action proposed or refused. (20 USC
1415[b][3] and [4], 1415[c][1], 1414[b][1]; 34 CFR 300.503)
Parental Consent
When is my approval required for assessment?
You have the right to refer your child for special education services. You must give informed,
written consent before your child’s first special education assessment can proceed. The parent
has at least fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the proposed assessment plan to arrive at a
decision. The assessment may begin immediately upon receipt of the consent and must be
completed and an IEP developed within sixty (60) days of your consent.
When is my approval required for services?
You must give informed, written consent before your school district can provide your child with
special education and related services.
What are the procedures when a parent does not provide consent?
If you do not provide consent for an initial assessment or fail to respond to a request to provide
the consent, the school district may pursue the initial assessment by utilizing due process
procedures.
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 4 of 14
If you refuse to consent to the initiation of services, the school district must not provide special
education and related services and shall not seek to provide services through due process
procedures.
If you consent in writing to the special education and related services for your child but do not
consent to all of the components of the IEP, those components of the program to which you
have consented must be implemented without delay.
If the school district determines that the proposed special education program component to
which you do not consent is necessary to provide a free appropriate public education to your
child, a due process hearing must be initiated. If a due process hearing is held, the hearing
decision shall be final and binding.
In the case of reevaluations, the school district must document reasonable measures to obtain
your consent. If you fail to respond, the school district may proceed with the reevaluation without
your consent. (20 USC 1414[a][1][D] and 1414[c]; 34 CFR 300.300; EC 56506[e], 56321[c] and
[d], and 56346).
When may I revoke consent?
If at any time subsequent to the initial provision of special education and related services, the
parent of a child revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special education and
related services, the public agency:
1. May not continue to provide special education and related services to the child, but must
provide prior written notice in accordance with 34 CFR Section 300.503 before ceasing such
services
2. May not use the procedures in subpart E of Part 300 34 CFR (including the mediation
procedures under 34 CFR Section 300.506 or the due process procedures under 34 CFR
Sections 300.507 through 300.516) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services
may be provided to the child
3. Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make a free appropriate public
education (FAPE) available to the child because of the failure to provide the child with
further special education and related services
4. Is not required to convene an IEP team meeting or develop an IEP under 34 CFR Sections
300.320 and 300.324 for the child for further provision of special education and related
services
Please note, in accordance with 34 CFR Section 300.9 (c)(3), that if the parents revoke consent
in writing for their child’s receipt of special education services after the child is initially provided
special education and related services, the public agency is not required to amend the child’s
education records to remove any references to the child’s receipt of special education and
related services because of the revocation of consent.
Surrogate Parent Appointment
What if a parent cannot be identified or located?
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 5 of 14
School districts must ensure that an individual is assigned to act as a surrogate parent for the
parents of a child with a disability when a parent cannot be identified and the school district
cannot discover the whereabouts of a parent.
A surrogate parent may also be appointed if the child is an unaccompanied homeless youth, an
adjudicated dependent or ward of the court under the state Welfare and Institution Code, and is
referred to special education or already has an IEP. (20 USC 1415[b][2] ; 34 CFR 300.519; EC
56050; GC 7579.5 and 7579.6)
Nondiscriminatory Assessment
How is my child assessed for special education services?
You have the right to have your child assessed in all areas of suspected disability. Materials and
procedures used for assessment and placement must not be racially, culturally, or sexually
discriminatory.
Assessment materials must be provided and the test administered in your child’s native
language or mode of communication and in the form most likely to yield accurate information on
what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally, and functionally, unless it is
clearly not feasible to so provide or administer.
No single procedure can be the sole criterion for determining eligibility and developing FAPE for
your child. (20 USC 1414[b][1]–[3], 1412[a][6][B]; 34 CFR 300.304; EC 56001[j] and 56320)
Independent Educational Assessments
May my child be tested independently at the district’s expense?
If you disagree with the results of the assessment conducted by the school district, you have the
right to ask for and obtain an independent educational assessment for your child from a person
qualified to conduct the assessment at public expense.
The parent is entitled to only one independent educational evaluation at public expense each
time the public agency conducts an evaluation with which the parent disagrees.
The school district must respond to your request for an independent educational assessment
and provide you information about where to obtain an independent educational assessment.
If the school district believes that the district’s assessment is appropriate and disagrees that an
independent assessment is necessary, the school district must request a due process hearing
to prove that its assessment was appropriate. If the district prevails, you still have the
right to an independent assessment but not at public expense. The IEP team must consider
independent assessments.
District assessment procedures allow in-class observation of students. If the school district
observes your child in his or her classroom during an assessment, or if the school district would
have been allowed to observe your child, an individual conducting an independent educational
assessment must also be allowed to observe your child in the classroom.
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 6 of 14
If the school district proposes a new school setting for your child and an independent
educational assessment is being conducted, the independent assessor must be allowed to first
observe the proposed new setting. (20 USC 1415[b][1] and [d][2][A]; 34 CFR 300.502; EC
56329[b] and [c])
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 7 of 14
Access to Educational Records
May I examine my child’s educational records?
You have a right to inspect and review all of your child’s education records without unnecessary
delay, including prior to a meeting about your child’s IEP or before a due process hearing. The
school district must provide you access to records and copies, if requested, within five (5)
business days after the request has been made orally or in writing. (EC 49060, 56043[n],
56501[b][3], and 56504)
How Disputes Are Resolved
Due Process Hearing
When is a due process hearing available?
You have the right to request an impartial due process hearing regarding the identification,
assessment, and educational placement of your child or the provision of FAPE. The request for
a due process hearing must be filed within two years from the date you knew or should have
known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the due process complaint. (20 USC
1415[b][6]; 34 CFR 300.507; EC 56501 and 56505[l])
Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution
May I request mediation or an alternative way to resolve the dispute?
A request for mediation may be made either before or after a request for a due process hearing
is made.
You may ask the school district to resolve disputes through mediation or alternative dispute
resolution (ADR), which is less adversarial than a due process hearing. The ADR and mediation
are voluntary methods of resolving a dispute and may not be used to delay your right to a due
process hearing.
What is a pre-hearing mediation conference?
You may seek resolution through mediation prior to filing a request for a due process hearing.
The conference is an informal proceeding conducted in a nonadversarial manner to resolve
issues relating to the identification, assessment, or educational placement of a child or to a
FAPE.
At the prehearing mediation conference, the parent or the school district may be accompanied
and advised by nonattorney representatives and may consult with an attorney prior to or

following the conference. However, requesting or participating in a prehearing mediation
conference is not a prerequisite to requesting a due process hearing.
All requests for a prehearing mediation conference shall be filed with the Superintendent. The
party initiating a prehearing mediation conference by filing a written request with the
Superintendent shall provide the other party to the mediation with a copy of the request at the
same time the request is filed.
The prehearing mediation conference shall be scheduled within fifteen (15) days of receipt by
the Superintendent of the request for mediation and shall be completed within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the request for mediation unless both parties agree to extend the time. If a
resolution is reached, the parties shall execute a legally binding written agreement that sets
forth the resolution. All discussions during the mediation process shall be confidential. All
prehearing mediation conferences shall be scheduled in a timely manner and held at a time and
place reasonably convenient to the parties. If the issues fail to be resolved to the satisfaction of
all parties, the party who requested the mediation conference has the option of filing for a due
process hearing. (EC 56500.3 and 56503)

Filing a Written Due Process Complaint
How do I request a due process hearing?
You need to file a written request for a due process hearing. You or your representative needs
to submit the following information in your request:
1. Name of the child
2. Address of the residence of the child
3. Name of the school the child is attending
4. In the case of a homeless child, available contact information for the child and the name of
the school the child is attending, and
5. A description of the nature of the problem, including facts relating to the problem(s) and a
proposed resolution of the problem(s)
Federal and state laws require that either party filing for a due process hearing must provide a
copy of the written request to the other party. (20 USC 1415[b][7], 1415[c][2]; 34 CFR 300.508;
EC 56502[c][1])
Prior to filing for a due process hearing, the school district shall be provided the opportunity to
resolve the matter by convening a resolution session, which is a meeting between the parents
and the relevant members of the IEP team who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in
the due process hearing request. (20 USC 1415[f][1][B]; 34 CFR 300.510)
What does a resolution session include?
Resolution sessions shall be convened within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice of
the parents’ due process hearing request. The sessions shall include a representative of the
school district who has decision-making authority and not include an attorney of the school
district unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney. The parent of the child may discuss
the due process hearing issue and the facts that form the basis of the due process hearing
request.
The resolution session is not required if the parent and the school district agree in writing to
waive the meeting. If the school district has not resolved the due process hearing issue within
thirty (30) days, the due process hearing may occur. If a resolution is reached, the parties shall
execute a legally binding agreement. (20 USC 1415[f][1][B]; 34 CFR 300.510)
Does my child’s placement change during the proceedings?
The child involved in any administrative or judicial proceeding must remain in the current
educational placement unless you and the school district agree on another arrangement.
If you are applying for initial admission of your child to a public school, your child will be placed
in a public school program with your consent until all proceedings are completed. (20 USC
1415[j]; 34 CFR 300.518; EC 56505[d])

May the decision be appealed?
The hearing decision is final and binding on both parties. Either party may appeal the hearing
decision by filing a civil action in state or federal court within 90 days of the final decision. (20
USC 1415[i][2] and [3][A], 1415[l]; 34 CFR 300.516; EC 56505[h] and [k], EC 56043[w])
Who pays for my attorneys’ fees?
In any action or proceeding regarding the due process hearing, the court, in its discretion, may
award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs to you as parent of a child with a disability
if you are the prevailing party in the hearing. Reasonable attorneys’ fees may also be made
following the conclusion of the administrative hearing, with the agreement of the parties. (20
USC 1415[i][3][B]–[G]; 34 CFR 300.517; EC 56507[b])
Fees may be reduced if any of the following conditions prevail:
1. The court finds that you unreasonably delayed the final resolution of the controversy
2. The attorneys’ hourly fees exceed the prevailing rate in the community
for similar services by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, reputation, and experience
3. The time spent and legal services provided were excessive, or
4. Your attorney did not provide to the school district the appropriate information in the due
process request notice.
Attorneys’ fees will not be reduced, however, if the court finds that the State or the school
district unreasonably delayed the final resolution of the action or proceeding or that there was a
violation of this section of law. (20 USC 1415[i][3][B]-[G]; 34 CFR 300.517)
Attorneys’ fees relating to any meeting of the IEP team may not be awarded unless an IEP team
meeting is convened as a result of a due process hearing proceeding or judicial action.
Attorneys’ fees may also be denied if you reject a reasonable settlement offer made by the
district/public agency ten (10) days before the hearing begins and the hearing decision is not
more favorable than the offer of settlement. (20 USC 1415[i][3][B]–[G]; 34 CFR 300.517)

School Discipline and Placement Procedures
for Students with Disabilities
School Discipline and Alternative Interim Educational Settings
May my child be suspended or expelled?
School personnel may consider any unique circumstances on a case-by-case basis when
determining whether a change in placement is appropriate for a child with a disability who
violates a code of student conduct from his or her setting to:
• An appropriate interim alternative education setting, another setting, or suspension for
not more than ten (10) consecutive school days, and
• Additional removals of not more than ten (10) consecutive school days in the same
school year for separate incidents of misconduct
What occurs after a removal of more than ten (10) days?
After a child with a disability has been removed from his or her current placement for ten (10)
school days in the same school year, during any subsequent days of removal the public agency
must provide services to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education
curriculum and progress toward meeting the goals set out in the child’s IEP. Also, a child will
receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention
services and modifications, which are designed to address the behavior violation so that it does
not recur.
If a child exceeds ten (10) days in such a placement, an IEP team meeting must be held to
determine whether the child’s misconduct is caused by the disability. This IEP team meeting
must take place immediately, if possible, or within ten (10) days of the school district’s decision
to take this type of disciplinary action.
As a parent you will be invited to participate as a member of this IEP team. The school district
may be required to develop an assessment plan to address the misconduct or, if your child has
a behavior intervention plan, review and modify the plan as necessary.
What happens if the IEP team determines that the misconduct is not caused by
the disability?
If the IEP team concludes that the misconduct was not a manifestation of the child’s disability,
the school district may take disciplinary action, such as expulsion, in the same manner as it
would for a child without a disability. (20 USC 1415[k][1] and [7]; 34 CFR 300.530)
If you disagree with the IEP team’s decision, you may request an expedited due process
hearing, which must occur within twenty (20) school days of the date on which you requested
the hearing. (20 USC 1415[k][2]; 34 CFR 300.531[c])
Regardless of the setting the school district must continue to provide FAPE for your child.
Alternative educational settings must allow the child to continue to participate in the general
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B

Page 12 of 14
curriculum and ensure continuation of services and modifications detailed in the IEP. (34 CFR
300.530; EC 48915.5[b])
Children Attending Private School
May students who are parentally placed in private schools participate in publicly
funded special education programs?
Children who are enrolled by their parents in private schools may participate in publicly funded
special education programs. The school district must consult with private schools and with
parents to determine the services that will be offered to private school students. Although school
districts have a clear responsibility to offer FAPE to students with disabilities, those children,
when placed by their parent in private schools, do not have the right to receive some
or all of the special education and related services necessary to provide FAPE. (20 USC
1415[a][10][A]; 34 CFR 300.137 and 300.138; EC 56173)
If a parent of an individual with exceptional needs who previously received special education
and related services under the authority of the school district enrolls the child in a private
elementary school or secondary school without the consent of or referral by the local
educational agency, the school district is not required to provide special education if the district
has made FAPE available. A court or a due process hearing officer may require the school
district to reimburse the parent or guardian for the cost of special education and the private
school only if the court or due process hearing officer finds that the school district had not made
FAPE available to the child in a timely manner prior to that enrollment in the private elementary
school or secondary school and that the private placement is appropriate. (20 USC
1412[a][10][C]; 34 CFR 300.148; EC 56175)
When may reimbursement be reduced or denied?
The court or hearing officer may reduce or deny reimbursement if you did not make your child
available for an assessment upon notice from the school district before removing your child from
public school. You may also be denied reimbursement if you did not inform the school district
that you were rejecting the special education placement proposed by the school district,
including stating your concerns and intent to enroll your child in a private school at public
expense.
Your notice to the school district must be given either:
• At the most recent IEP team meeting you attended before removing your child from the
public school, or
• In writing to the school district at least ten (10) business days (including holidays) before
removing your child from the public school. (20 USC 1412[a][10][C]; 34 CFR 300.148;
EC 56176)
When may reimbursement not be reduced or denied?
CHAPTER 16
APPENDIX B
Notice of Procedural Safeguards
CDE, T07-037, English, Arial font
Page 13 of 14
A court or hearing officer must not reduce or deny reimbursement to you if you failed to provide
written notice to the school district for any of the following reasons:
• The school prevented you from providing notice
• You had not received a copy of this Notice of Procedural Safeguards or otherwise been
informed of the requirement to notify the district
• Providing notice would likely have resulted in physical harm to your child
• Illiteracy and inability to write in English prevented you from providing notice, or
• Providing notice would likely have resulted in serious emotional harm to your child
(20 USC 1412[a] [10] [C]; 34 CFR 300.148; EC 56177)
State Complaint Procedures
When may I file a state compliance complaint?
You may file a state compliance complaint when you believe that a school district has violated
federal or state special education laws or regulations. Your written complaint must specify at
least one alleged violation of federal and state special education laws. The violation must have
occurred not more than one year prior to the date the complaint is received by the California
Department of Education (CDE). When filing a complaint, you must forward a copy of the
complaint to the school district at the same time you file a state compliance complaint with the
CDE. (34 CFR 300.151–153; 5 CCR 4600)
Complaints alleging violations of federal and state special education laws or regulations may be
mailed to:

currently on track to satisfy those requirements, graduation is the only valid option. Upon his or her
graduation, your child will no longer be eligible for special education services. It is the District’s
determination that any other option, such as retention or a certificate of completion, is not
appropriate for at this time. Upon request, an IEP meeting may be
convened to discuss this recommendation

model (e.g., push-in, pull- out), inclusion percentage, any specifics}. You did not provide consent to this

Our state legislature expects public schools and parents to be mutually supportive and respectful
partners in the education of California’s school children. (California Education Code Section 51101.)
The District takes this mandate seriously; and therefore, I ask that you contact me as soon as possible
regarding your child’s IEP.
Thank you for your time and prompt response in this matter.

[DATE]
[PARENTS’ NAME & ADDRESS]
Re: [STUDENT’S NAME AND DOB]
Dear _____________:
On _________________ [DATE], the [___________ School District] (“District”) received your
written notice revoking consent to the District’s continued provision of special education
services and placement for your [SON/DAUGHTER]. This letter responds to your
__________ [DATE] letter, wherein you revoked your consent for your child, [NAME], to
receive special education and related services from the District. Please consider this the
District’s response to your request under Title 34 Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”)
sections 300.300 and 300.503.
The District believes that [NAME] continues to require special education and related services pursuant
to the individualized education program (“IEP”) meeting convened on [DATE] based upon the
following information: (1) a review of [NAME’s] student records; (2) input from the members of
[NAME’s] IEP team; (3) observation of [NAME’s] school performance; and (4) a review of
[NAME’s] assessments, specifically, [SPECIFY EACH EVALUATION / ASSESSMENT/
REPORT], including independent assessments; (5) [NAME’s] progress on her/his goals; and, (6) all
other available information.
However, based on the receipt of your written revocation of consent, the District will
discontinue all special education and related services for [NAME] on [DATE]. After that
date, [NAME] will no longer receive the educational services and supports contained in
[his/her] [DATE(S)] IEP, which include, but are not limited to: [LIST PLACEMENT,
SERVICES, ACCOMMODATIONS, MODIFICATIONS, AND/OR SUPPORTS,
INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL SUPPORTS, STUDENT WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE].
Beginning on [DATE] [INSERT THE SCHOOL DAY AFTER THE DAY THAT SPECIAL
EDUCATION SERVICES STOP], [NAME] will be placed in a general education classroom
[IF NEEDED, INSERT DESCRIPTION OF GENERAL EDUCATION PLACEMENT]. At
that time, [NAME] will only have access to those supports, accommodations, and
opportunities that are made available to general education students.
Please be advised that after [DATE], [NAME] will become a general education student and
will no longer be entitled to the special education and related services, rights and procedural

safeguards provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of
2004 (“IDEA”) and related provisions in the California Education Code. [NAME] will be
treated as a general education student in all respects, including discipline as well as Districtwide
testing (such as STAR testing), [and graduation, if appropriate]. As a result, [NAME]’s
disability will not be taken into consideration when determining appropriate disciplinary
action and [he/she] will not be entitled to the IDEA’s discipline protections.
Your revocation of consent releases the District from its obligation to provide your child with
a free appropriate public education. If, in the future, you would like your child to receive
special education and related services from the District, please contact us. The District will
treat such a request as a request for an initial evaluation.
The District has considered all available information in ceasing the provision of special
education services to your [SON/DAUGHTER.] The District would like to meet with you on
[DATE] to discuss your decision and its potential impacts. However, our invitation to meet
is entirely voluntary. You are not obligated to meet with us and any meeting will not delay
or deny the discontinuation of special education and related services to your child. Please
contact _____________ at [INSERT CONTACT INFORMATION] to confirm whether you
will attend the meeting. If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you do not wish to
meet.
I have enclosed a copy of the District’s parental rights and procedural safeguards. Please feel
free to contact me with any questions you may have at this time. You may also contact the
following sources to obtain assistance in understanding your rights:

or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
