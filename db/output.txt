MODIFICATIONS
Modifications allow the student to be more successful but fundamentally alter or lower course standards or student
expectations. The provision of these modifications means that:
1. The student’s grade may not count towards the honor roll or academic awards.
2. Modified grades may affect a student’s class ranking.
3. The student may not be fully exposed to curriculum in preparation for taking the Statewide Assessment.
4. A student provided with modified curriculum/grades might not graduate with a regular diploma.

Subject Content Grading Requirements Grad*ing
* The report card will show a modified grade but will not indicate that the student has received special education and related
services unless doing so would help the parent or guardian to understand the progress his or her child is making in specific
classes, course content, or curriculum. High school transcripts will show a modified grade but will not indicate that the
student has received special education and related services. Post-secondary institutions will not be provided with an
explanation of the modified grade and of the student’s special education status without written consent of the parent or

graduated from high school to collect data on post school outcomes.

his or her participation in the program for the remainder of the current fiscal
year, including any extended school year program for individuals with
exceptional needs.
B) Any person otherwise eligible to participate in a program under this part shall
not be allowed to begin a new fiscal year in a program if he or she becomes 22
years of age in July, August or September or that new fiscal year. However, if
a person is in a year-round school program and is completing his or her

7.19 SUGGESTED TRANSITION AND EXIT GUIDELINES
Special education and related services is a service that may be short term or long term in
duration. It is an intervention designed to remediate deficits and address disabling
conditions that prevent success in regular education curriculum. The overall goal of
special education is to develop the skills necessary to successfully access the regular
education curriculum. This skill development, in conjunction with appropriate supports
and accommodations in the regular education program should establish a transition of
decreased special education services to increased regular education services. In some
cases, there may be a complete dismissal from special education. This transition and
dismissal addresses the least restrictive environment principle and practice, as required
of the IEP Team, which includes regular education staff when the child is currently in
regular education or is being considered for regular education.

A specific learning disability means a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in
using language, spoken or written, that may have manifested itself in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell,
or do mathematical calculations, including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction,
dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. The basic psychological processes include attention, visual processing, auditory processing,
sensory-motor skills, and cognitive abilities including association, conceptualization and expression.
Section I. Instructions: Select Option A, B, or C below.
The decision as to whether or not a severe discrepancy exists takes into account all relevant material, which is available on the

as to the pupil’s eligibility for special education.
A. The IEP team finds a severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement based on valid standardized
tests.
B. The IEP team finds a severe discrepancy based on alternative measures as specified on the assessment plan.
